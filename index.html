<p>
  Mechanical Jung is an online personality predictor based on the theories of psychologist Carl Jung, similar to the contemporary Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI).  Instead of answering questions, the user enters some text or a Twitter handle and Mechanical Jung uses advanced text classification techniques to predict the personality type of the author or Twitter user.  You can try it <a href="http://mechanicaljung.com">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Mechanical Jung began as a semester project in <a href="http://courses.cse.tamu.edu/caverlee/csce470/">CSCE 470 <em>Information Storage and Retrieval</em></a> at Texas A&M University, taught by <a href="http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/caverlee/">Dr. James Caverlee</a>.  Mech Jung uses most of the course's core concepts: vector space modeling (of text), stopwords and stemming, TF-IDF, search engine optimization (Hover + Google Webmaster Tools FTW guys), kNN and naive Bayes classification, crawling, and interface design (like our web 1.0 homepage?).
</p>

<p>
  Naturally, we took it a step further, using natural language processing to normalize text and, in some cases, filter based on part-of-speech and lemmatize words.  We even used support vector machines, cross validation, and our own composite classification method (classifier voting) to produce results.

<p>
  How does it work?  We crawled the site <a href="http://celebritytypes.com">CelebrityTypes</a> to obtain our ground truth personality classifications.  Then we collected quotes and tweets for the nearly 600 personalities we found.  Our primary training set (8775 quotes) is a processed version of a crawled quote collection available from <a href="http://thewebminer.com">TheWebMiner</a>.  We used quotes that we crawled from Freebase as an evaluation set.  Tweets were retrieved with <a href="http://tweepy.org">Tweepy</a>.  Many of the names in our ground truth database matched WebMiner names and Twitter handles, but we had to match many of them by hand.
</p>

<p>
  The text area on the homepage submits to a set of classifiers pre-trained on various versions of the primary training set, whose data and targets (ground truths) are available <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WR5SA6ya2NN4szKWPTdU_8nxJjjm7POKNWpFg_cVY4Q/edit?usp=sharing">here</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18VxwucpEm4-_y7bhTmLb2weCeRDkRBot6EtZRcgilcg/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>, respectively.  Any text submitted to Mech Jung is immediately transformed by various language processes and input into the appropriate "pipelines", which vectorize and classify it.  A four-letter personality type is actually generated by four different classifiers, one for each preference (I/E, N/S, F/T, J/P).  At the time of this writing, the committee of classifiers for the text submission consists of nine sets of four classifiers each.  Each of the nine sets uses a different combination of classification and language processing method.

  Senior computer science major at Texas A&M, I enjoy music, basketball, and food. I was mainly responsible for making the site look pretty, handling nearly all of the front end development and becoming the resident tweepy expert, but also got the chance to work on some of our text processing and a bit of web crawling.<br>

  A senior computer science major at Texas A&M, I'm interested in web development and data analysis. I gathered and organized the data used and assisted with the front end development. When not coding, I spend my time outdoors, watching movies, or listening to podcasts.<br>

  Who am I to turn down an opportunity for shameless self promotion?  I'm a senior in CS at <a href="http://tamu.edu">TAMU</a>, an old soul, and the team's resident amateur expert on HTML parsing, REST, NLTK, and scikit-learn.  The original idea for Mechanical Jung was mine, but it's grown so much that I can't take credit for much more than that.<br>
