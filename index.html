<p>
  Mechanical Jung is an online personality profiler that draws from the writings of famed Psychologist Carl Jung. Using his eight personality types, Mechanical Jung takes text input, either user entered or from their Twitter posts, and returns a Jungian personality profile indictative of the text they've entered.<br><br>

  Personality tests are time consuming and unspecific. Mechanical Jung is instant and allows the user to see how their personality changes across different mediums, whether its professional writing or social media, giving them a robust view of how they communicate. We built this application as a CSCE 470 project at Texas A&M University taught by Dr. James Caverlee. It utilizes many core concepts we received exposure to in class (classifiers, web APIs, web crawling, ranked retrieval, TFIDF, etc.) and combines them into a simple application with powerful results.<br><br>

  We've gathered thousands of quotes and tweets from known personality types of famous and historical individuals. Using our database as training data, we created a Support Vector Classifier that uses users input to predict a Jungian Personality type.

  Senior computer science major at Texas A&M, I enjoy music, basketball, and food. I was mainly responsible for making the site look pretty, handling nearly all of the front end development and becoming the resident tweepy expert, but also got the chance to work on some of our text processing and a bit of web crawling.<br>

  A senior computer science major at Texas A&M, I'm interested in web development and data analysis. I gathered and organized the data used and assisted with the front end development. When not coding, I spend my time outdoors, watching movies, or listening to podcasts.<br>

  Who am I to turn down an opportunity for shameless self promotion?  I'm a senior in CS at <a href="http://tamu.edu">TAMU</a>, an old soul, and the team's resident amateur expert on HTML parsing, REST, NLTK, and scikit-learn.  The original idea for Mechanical Jung was mine, but it's grown so much that I can't take credit for much more than that.<br>
