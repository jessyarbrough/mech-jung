ESTP	we have entered an age in which education is not just a luxury permitting some men an advantage over others . it has become a necessity without which a person is defenseless in this complex , industrialized society . we have truly entered the century of the educated man .
INFJ	it is old age , rather than death , that is to be contrasted with life . old age is life s parody , whereas death transforms life into a destiny : in a way it preserves it by giving it the absolute dimension . death does away with time .
INFP	it s not catastrophes , murders , deaths , diseases , that age and kill us it s the way people look and laugh , and run up the steps of omnibuses .

INFP	o love , if i regret the age when one savors you , it is not for the hour of pleasure , but for the one that follows it .
ISFP	i am well past the age where i am acceptable . you get to a certain age and you are forbidden access . you are not going to get the kind of coverage that you would like in music magazines , you are not going to get played on radio and you are not going to get played on television . i have to survive on word of mouth .
INTJ	well , i am in my 60s now . i finally look it , i think . people until i was 60 would always say they thought i looked younger , which i think , without flattering myself , i did , but i think i certainly have , as george orwell says people do after a certain age , the face they deserve .
INTJ	bombing afghanistan back into the stone age  was quite a favourite headline for some wobbly liberals . the slogan does all the work . but an instant s thought shows that afghanistan is being , if anything , bombed out of the stone age .

INFP	you get to a certain age where you prepare yourself for happiness . sometimes you never remember to actually get happy .

ISFJ	i am not as far along as jack nicklaus was at this age , but i am trying .
INFP	you d think that in this age , especially in the 21st century - especially with all the technology and all the discoveries that we have made - that we would figure out how to tackle abuse .
ENTP	i never - you know also one of the things that would save me for a man my age , it was not that easy to lose that much weight and fall down and look like something draped .
ESTP	my justification is that most people my age spend a lot of time thinking about what they are going to do for the next five or ten years . the time they spend thinking about their life , i just spend drinking .
INFJ	at a certain age it just became apparent to me that this was probably the work that i would have to do .
ESFJ	why should 20-year-olds only be considered sexy ? i think we get better with age .
INTP	to be free in an age like ours , one must be in a position of authority . that in itself would be enough to make me ambitious .
INFJ	i remember at the age of five travelling on a trolley car with my mother past a group of women on a picket line at a textile plant , seeing them being viciously beaten by security people . so that kind of thing stayed with me .
ISTP	i am asked all the time in interviews about who i am , and i know a few people my age who have a strong sense of self , but i could not say i know myself and sum it up and give it to you in a little package . i do not know myself at all yet .
ENFP	every time i see something terrible , it s like i see it at age 19 . i keep a freshness that way .
ENFP	does age matter ? time does not matter .

ISFP	even from a very early age , i knew i did not want to miss out on anything life had to offer just because it might be considered dangerous .
ENFJ	i was a mixture of being incredibly old for my age and incredibly backwards . i was born quite old , but then i stopped growing . i lived with my mum and dad till i was 30 .
ESFJ	craziest thing i have done for love is getting married . i think it s crazy . i think it s crazy , crazy , crazy . i am never going to say i would not do it again but i have to make sure it s love and not settling for the i have to do this by a certain age ,  which is kind of what i did .
INFP	you never choose the way that you are raised , it s just the way that you were raised , but you do get to a certain age where you are in a position to question the expectations of you and the way that you have been formed by your surroundings .
ENTP	no , no , i was only funny on stage , really . i , i , think i was funny as a person toward my classmates when i was very young . you know , when i was a child , up to about the age of 12 .
ISTJ	i never had little brothers , so i was totally not used to hearing a lot of cussing at a young age ! i learned what pull my finger  meant the hard way .
ENTP	i wrote a screenplay for a sweet valley high  adaptation , and it s really amazing to me how many women who are my age have responded to the idea and are excited about the movie .
ISTP	my best friend just had a baby , and she s my age . so i am a godmom now , which is crazy .
ISTP	i think i am a bit less inhibited , and not thinking too much before speaking . it s not about being shameful , i am just a bit more unabashedly myself because of this thing , and it probably started at age 15 . i can be around people and say what i think without fear .
INFJ	the divine right of husbands , like the divine right of kings , may , it is hoped , in this enlightened age , be contested without danger .
INFJ	in every age there has been a stream of popular opinion that has carried all before it , and given a family character , as it were , to the century .
INFP	look , demanding somebody do anything in this day and age is not going to fly .
INFP	i was very successful from a very early age , and i want to keep it .
ENTJ	i do not believe in happy endings , but i do believe in happy travels , because ultimately , you die at a very young age , or you live long enough to watch your friends die . it s a mean thing , life .
ENTP	you can have a spiritual awakening and discover a new side of you at any age . and best of all , love can happen at any age . life can just start to get exciting when you are in your 40s and 50s . you have to believe that .
ESTP	america does not reward people of my age , either in day-to-day life or for their performances .
ENFJ	people tend to become more emotionally intelligent as they age and mature .
ESFJ	with age , you get to a place where you do not want to knock people out . you just want to give people a hug .
ESTJ	situational unawareness in the private marketplace or on the battlefield will cost you your livelihood or your life . in the age of obama , however , such willful ignorance is a job prerequisite . the less you know the better .
ENFP	i want to be part of the resurgence of things that are tangible , beautiful and soulful , rather than just give in to the digital age . but when i talk to people about this they just say , yeah , i know what you mean ,  and stare at their mobiles .
ISTP	the idea of regretting not doing this seemed insane to me . sitting in the corner at a bar at age 60 , saying : i could have been bond . buy me a drink .  that s the saddest place i could be . at least now at 60 i can say : i was bond . now buy me a drink . 
INFJ	it s not the normal way to look at things but i experienced death at a really young age and because of that it s been part of my mental landscape that death is really very possible .
INFJ	i have an enormous respect for my mother who at the age of 39 raised three children , and i grew up with my grandmother in the household . and so it was a really strong household of women - my poor brother ! it was great growing up with so many generations of women .
ENFJ	it lies in human nature that where you experience your first laughs , you also remember the age kindly .
ESFP	michelle pfeiffer has not been finding a lot of work recently because she does not like what a woman her age is offered . that s a real double standard . you get sean connery , who gets older and older , still playing opposite young ladies , but it does not work the other way around .
ENTJ	even one voice can be heard loudly all over the world in this day and age .
ENTJ	at this age , i should be leading a quiet life .
ISFJ	no , but way before that , i have been doing little dances in movies for years . yeah , that was an amazing chance . you know , at my age to be able to do a music dance video , very unusual .
ISFJ	there probably are not a lot of actors my age who tap dance .
ISTP	i started auditioning when i was about 10 and i did not get my first job until i was 12 , and two years at that age is really hard .
INTJ	i think women get caught up too much in having a plan - i am going to get married at this age i am going to have a kid at this age  - and then they just try to find a guy who will fit into that picture . i do not want my life to be based on that .
ENFP	i think you ca not really escape any kind of spiritual education as a child , whether it s new age or judaism or buddhism or whatever it is . you ca not escape it , even if you completely disagree with it , you still have it as a foundation that you base things off of .
ESFJ	we live in an age , in an era where there is so much negativity , there is so much violence in the world , there is so much unrest and people are at war , that i wanted to promote the word love and red signifies love .
INFP	at a young age , i was interested in comic books , which was really how i learnt to read . the name cage came from a comic book character called power man .
ESFP	i ca not wait to be that age and hanging out with a bunch of people hanging out all day playing golf and going to the beach , all my own age . we d be laughing and having a good time and getting loopy on our prescription drugs . driving golf carts around . i ca not wait .
ESFP	i would love a family . i am at the age where the wish for a child gets stronger . but who knows .
ESFP	i love physical kinds of comedy and getting down and dirty and doing stunts . when i was growing up , i was always getting into fights with guys and usually punching out boys my age because i was a lot bigger and tougher . so i am naturally accustomed to putting myself into the headspace of a girl who can take care of herself .
ENTJ	maybe it is something to do with age , but i have become fonder of poetry than of prose .
INFJ	i grew up on the golden age of children s tv .
INFJ	you need some insecurity if you are an actor . it keeps the pot boiling . i have not yet started to think about retiring . i was shocked when i heard about paul newman retiring at age 82 . most actors just fade away like old soldiers .
INFP	the age thing really bugs me . do people have more of a right to not like what i say because i am 19 ?
INTP	by the age of 9 or 10 , i knew that i had to cut my own cloth and make my own way .
INTP	when you are my age and you see a story , you better go for it pretty quickly . i d just like to get a few more novels under my belt .
INTP	i do not know whether it s age or maturity , but i certainly find myself committed more and more to the looser forms of western democracy at any price .
INFP	i try to write lyrics so that they wo not age , which sort of leaves you with the big subjects like death and love and sex and violence .
ENTP	in the modern media age we are rarely surprised by what we see . whether it s on television or film or in the theatre , everything is so advertised , so trailed , that most entertainment is merely what you thought it was going to be like .
INFP	maybe i will be a feminist in my old age .
INFP	i feel the 21st century is another new age . not only can we collaborate again with nature , but we have to . it s an emergency .
ISFP	i d date someone younger or older age does not matter to me . or looks , really - it s all about maturity .

INFP	well , once you have resigned yourself to the fact that you are the more mature pop performer and you are past the age you ever thought you would do it , you might as well do it as long as you can . as long as i can still lift a microphone , then i will do it , you know .
ESTJ	i think it s hard , the fact that there s a certain age that we ca not have kids anymore .
ENFP	my mother was 45 when she had me , so when i was in high school my parents were the same age as my friends  grandparents .
ISTP	despite what anti-aging ads say , growing older can be better . i feel better in my skin , 100 percent . you have greater effects of gravity , but the better sense of yourself you have is something i would not trade . women who lie about their age - why ? 
ISTP	for the moment i prefer to be a beautiful woman of my age than try desperately to look 30 .
INFJ	to write a story about new york that only deals with people in your age and socioeconomic bracket , that feels dishonest to me . so much of new york comes from everyone bumping into each other .
ESFP	i have always been intrigued by color and by interesting hair . i was one of those weird little girls doing my own hair at the age of 9 . i was , like , getting weird gels and new brushes and cornrow holders . i would tweak and perm at the age of 13 .
ISTP	my parents got married late and they had kids late , so i never felt a social or cultural thing to be married or pregnant or a homeowner by a certain age .
ISTP	i am a pretty big dork . it s crazy . i am one of those people who grew up with all kinds of musicals , but i was right at that age where rent  was a big deal for me and for my friends .
ISTP	my parents were really , really cool about supporting what i wanted to do at a really young age . i think i was about 10 when i caught the bug . they would drive me down to new york if there were auditions . when i was 12 , i did this show on broadway called high society ,  so we moved to new york for the run of that .
INFP	well , my son really loves wildlife . and everytime he draws a polar bear i want to tell him there probably wo not any by the time ... he s my age . that s kinda hard to deal with .
INFP	traveling to russia and germany and being able to see the world at a young age was really cool for me , and i really liked that .
ESFP	i think the most exciting thing is that you expect people our age to know the music , but actually a lot of kids know the music , and if anything is left , we have left really good music , and that s the important part , not the mop-tops or whatever .
INTP	it is strange to be known so universally and yet to be so lonely .
ISFP	it s often just enough to be with someone . i do not need to touch them . not even talk . a feeling passes between you both . you are not alone .
ISTJ	associate with men of good quality if you esteem your own reputation for it is better to be alone than in bad company .
ISFP	i restore myself when i am alone .
ISFP	i have to be alone very often . i d be quite happy if i spent from saturday night until monday morning alone in my apartment . that s how i refuel .
ISFP	i do not want to be alone , i want to be left alone .
ESFP	you can not be lonely if you like the person you are alone with .
ENFP	if it s true that our species is alone in the universe , then i d have to say the universe aimed rather low and settled for very little .
INTJ	every man must do two things alone he must do his own believing and his own dying .
ESFJ	loneliness is my least favorite thing about life . the thing that i am most worried about is just being alone without anybody to care for or someone who will care for me .
ESFJ	i finally faced the fact that it is not a crime not having friends . being alone means you have fewer problems .
INFP	the only real progress lies in learning to be wrong all alone .
INTJ	if you are lonely when you are alone , you are in bad company .
ENTP	we are rarely proud when we are alone .
INTJ	it s an interesting combination : having a great fear of being alone , and having a desperate need for solitude and the solitary experience . that s always been a tug of war for me .
ENFP	still and all , why bother ? here s my answer . many people need desperately to receive this message : i feel and think much as you do , care about many of the things you care about , although most people do not care about them . you are not alone .
ISFP	there s a tremendous difference between alone and lonely . you could be lonely in a group of people . i like being alone . i like eating by myself . i go home at night and just watch a movie or hang out with my dog . i have to exert myself and really say , oh god , i have got to see my friends cause i am too content being by myself .
ISFP	the best part about being alone is that you really do not have to answer to anybody . you do what you want .

ISFP	it s better to be unhappy alone than unhappy with someone - so far .
ISTJ	nothing in this world can take the place of persistence . talent will not nothing is more common than unsuccessful people with talent . genius will not unrewarded genius is almost a proverb . education will not the world is full of educated failures . persistence and determination alone are omnipotent .
INFJ	every government degenerates when trusted to the rulers of the people alone . the people themselves are its only safe depositories .
INFJ	it is error alone which needs the support of government . truth can stand by itself .
ENFP	the best remedy for those who are afraid , lonely or unhappy is to go outside , somewhere where they can be quiet , alone with the heavens , nature and god . because only then does one feel that all is as it should be .
INTJ	our lord has written the promise of resurrection , not in books alone , but in every leaf in springtime .

ISFP	i am alone i am always alone no matter what .
ISFP	some of my foster families used to send me to the movies to get me out of the house and there i d sit all day and way into the night . up in front , there with the screen so big , a little kid all alone , and i loved it . i loved anything that moved up there and i did not miss anything that happened and there was no popcorn either .

INFJ	anger is the enemy of non-violence and pride is a monster that swallows it up .
INFJ	i know , to banish anger altogether from one s breast is a difficult task . it can not be achieved through pure personal effort . it can be done only by god s grace .
INFJ	we should meet abuse by forbearance . human nature is so constituted that if we take absolutely no notice of anger or abuse , the person indulging in it will soon weary of it and stop .
ENTP	anger is never without a reason , but seldom with a good one .

ENFP	i do not think that you can fake warmth . you can fake lust , jealousy , anger those are all quite easy . but actual , genuine warmth ? i do not think you can fake it .
ESFJ	it is not enough just to scream at the occupy wall street demonstrations . we need our political system to start reflect this anger back into , how do we fix it ? how do we get the economy going again ? 
ESTP	obama and his attack dogs have nothing but hate and anger in their hearts and spew it whenever possible .
ISFP	you have just got to have a sense of respect for the person you have children with . anger does not help anybody . ultimately you have to say forgiveness is important , and honoring what you had together is important . but it s easy to say and harder to do .
ESTJ	a lot of my humor does come from anger . it s like , you are not gon na pull one over on me - which is pretty much my motto anyways .
ISFP	george wrote taxman , and i played guitar on it . he wrote it in anger at finding out what the taxman did . he had never known before then what could happen to your money .
ESTP	i do not think your ability to fight has anything to do with how big you are . it s to do with how much anger is in you .

ENFP	well , all comedy starts with anger . you get angry , and its never for a good reason , right ? you know its not a good reason . and then you try and work it from there .
ISFP	i turned to music originally because of my past and needing a release or an outlet to get out anger or frustration or hurt .
ENFP	i am not a screamer . i am confrontational , but i do not think that translates into anger .
ENFJ	your anger is a gift .

INTJ	there is no more lovely , friendly and charming relationship , communion or company than a good marriage .
ENTP	marriage is the most natural state of man , and ... the state in which you will find solid happiness .
ISFP	experts on romance say for a happy marriage there has to be more than a passionate love . for a lasting union , they insist , there must be a genuine liking for each other . which , in my book , is a good definition for friendship .
ISFJ	mom and dad were married 64 years . and if you wondered what their secret was , you could have asked the local florist - because every day dad gave mom a rose , which he put on her bedside table . that s how she found out what happened on the day my father died - she went looking for him because that morning , there was no rose .
ENTP	so while an incredible amount of progress has been made , on this fifth anniversary , i wanted to come here and tell the people of this city directly : my administration is going to stand with you - and fight alongside you - until the job is done . until new orleans is all the way back , all the way .

ESTP	prose is architecture , not interior decoration , and the baroque is over .
ESTP	switzerland is a small , steep country , much more up and down than sideways , and is all stuck over with large brown hotels built on the cuckoo clock style of architecture .
ENTP	the ancient romans built their greatest masterpieces of architecture , their amphitheaters , for wild beasts to fight in .
INTJ	i could have been an architect , but i do not think i d have been very happy . nearly all modern architecture is a silly game as far as i can see .
ISFP	i am drawn to furniture design as complete architecture on a minor scale .
ENFJ	i would have been intrigued by being a film director . i would have been intrigued by politics . i thought about architecture .
INTP	true art is characterized by an irresistible urge in the creative artist .
INTP	the highest art is always the most religious , and the greatest artist is always a devout person .
ENTJ	the aim of art is to represent not the outward appearance of things , but their inward significance .

ENFP	no great artist ever sees things as they really are . if he did , he would cease to be an artist .
ESTP	without tradition , art is a flock of sheep without a shepherd . without innovation , it is a corpse .
INTJ	the essence of all beautiful art , all great art , is gratitude .

ENFP	life imitates art far more than art imitates life .
INFP	a guilty conscience needs to confess . a work of art is a confession .

ENTJ	my attitude to peace is rather based on the burmese definition of peace - it really means removing all the negative factors that destroy peace in this world . so peace does not mean just putting an end to violence or to war , but to all other factors that threaten peace , such as discrimination , such as inequality , poverty .

ISTP	i met my grandfather just before he died , and it was the first time that i had seen dad with a relative of his . it was interesting to see my own father as a son and the body language and alteration in attitude that comes with that , and it sort of changed our relationship for the better .

ISTJ	if a business does well , the stock eventually follows .
ISFJ	and fifth , we will champion small businesses , america s engine of job growth . that means reducing taxes on business , not raising them . it means simplifying and modernizing the regulations that hurt small business the most . and it means that we must rein in the skyrocketing cost of healthcare by repealing and replacing obamacare .

ESFJ	no person will make a great business who wants to do it all himself or get all the credit .
INFP	mental fight means thinking against the current , not with it . it is our business to puncture gas bags and discover the seeds of truth .
ESTP	so we really need jobs now . we have to take jobs away from other countries because other countries are taking our jobs . there is practically not a country that does business with the united states that is not making - let s call it a very big profit . i mean china is going to make $ 300 billion on us at least this year .
ESTP	but i believe in fair trade , and i will tell you , i have many , many friends heading up corporations , and people that do just business in china , they say it s virtually impossible . it s very , very hard to come into china . and yet , we welcome them with open arms .

ESFP	to me , business is not about wearing suits or pleasing stockholders . it s about being true to yourself , your ideas and focusing on the essentials .

INFP	it s like you always have to put on a happy face , be the phony baloney , and i am so not that . i never was that i will never be that . that is part of the business that i do not like . maybe that will always keep me an outsider , i do not know . but that s fine .

INTJ	i think a simple rule of business is , if you do the things that are easier first , then you can actually make a lot of progress .

ENTJ	good business leaders create a vision , articulate the vision , passionately own the vision , and relentlessly drive it to completion .
ESFP	i am someone who loves to enjoy life and tries to focus on real things and real friendships . that s why i live very simply . i am a jeans and t-shirt kind of girl . i do not spend much time fixing myself up or trying to look cool . i live like a normal person and even though i am in a very high-profile business , i really do not let it affect the way i live .
INFP	almost anyone can be an author the business is to collect money and fame from this state of being .
ESFJ	i started out mopping floors , waiting tables , and tending bar at my dad s tavern . i put myself through school working odd jobs and night shifts . i poured my heart and soul into a small business . and when i saw how out-of-touch washington had become with the core values of this great nation , i put my name forward and ran for office .
INTJ	for the first time we are allowing developers who do not work at facebook to develop applications just as if they were . that s a big deal because it means that all developers have a new way of doing business if they choose to take advantage of it . there are whole companies that are forming whose only product is a facebook platform application .
ISFJ	i feel lazy when i am not working . i learned all my business sense from my dad . he always believed in me , and i think the last thing he said to me before he passed away was , i know you are gon na be ok . i am not worried about you  .
ENTJ	there is one other business where the customer is always wrong and that s the media .

ESFJ	i am a mad lover of sport . you can not say a bad word to me about sports . so i know business is involved and i know it can be cynical , and , of course , i watch it , but for me it s pure .
ESFJ	at the end of drama school , i made a contract with myself : i d try acting for five years . i was 26 . i had already spent eight years working in restaurants and gas stations . so i had seen enough small businesses to understand that that s what acting is : a small business .

INFP	the business side of film has goofed up so many things , but even that s changing . it happened to the music industry and now it s happening to the film studios . it s crazy what s going on . but artists should have control of their work especially if , as i always say , you never turn down a good idea and never take a bad idea .
ESFP	i never get the accountants in before i start up a business . it s done on gut feeling , especially if i can see that they are taking the mickey out of the consumer .

ENFP	like sex in victorian england , the reality of big business today is our big dirty secret .

ISTJ	the common question that gets asked in business is , why ?  that s a good question , but an equally valid question is , why not ?

ISTJ	teenage girls these days are more and more getting lured into thinking they should dumb themselves down , and that s going to attract the wrong kind of guy , and it s serious . it s serious business .
ISTJ	the camera fails to capture the business  in show business ! we typically will give 10 percent of our salary to the agent , 10 percent to the manager , and 5 percent to the lawyer , plus the publicist gets a flat fee , which needs to be budgeted for .
ENFJ	i feel fine , i do not care who the director is . all you have to do is know what your doing - all of us - everybody in the business - that s all you ask anyone - you know your job , i know mine , let s go do it .
ISTP	i think people are used to seeing actors be wide open and desperately giving of themselves , and while i do that on a movie set as much as i can , it s so unnatural for me to do it on television , in interviews , in anything like that . i also do not find that my process as an actor is really anyone else s business .
ISFP	i am a child but i have to think and act like a woman , this business forces you to .
INTP	i was a good amateur but only an average professional . i soon realized that there was a limit to how far i could rise in the music business , so i left the band and enrolled at new york university .
ESFP	one thing is certain in business . you and everyone around you will make mistakes .
ENFJ	my view is that you still , in order to win from the labour perspective , have to have a strong alliance with business as well as the unions . you have got to be very much in the centre ground on things like public sector reform .

ISFP	i still have a lot to learn - about the business , about music , and about myself . its exciting .

INFJ	planning cities is a necessary but risky business .
ESFP	i am just at that stage of wondering where i go from here . i came into this business almost by accident , but now it has become serious . what started as a bit of fun , something to do other than be a model , has taken on a different career curve . i have been forced to ask where that curve is going to end up .
ISFJ	i think early on i knew what i was going to do and it was based a lot on familiarity but it was also because i did not have a lot of skills . there was nothing i wanted t be . i did not want to be a doctor . i wanted to be in show business .
ISFJ	i think that if i had grown up and had been in show business and the movies twenty five , thirty years earlier , i think i would have made a lot more musical movies .
ISFJ	i think the fact that i was raised in show business , in new york city , in the 50s , that s affected my personality to the point that i am a little different .
ISFJ	well , i was sort of a jack-of-all-trades in show business for a long time . i was a singer and a dancer and then i got a job as an actor .
ISFJ	i have made movies that i thought were good . i have made movies that i thought were okay , but then i was very good . and sometimes you are in a movie and you think , i wish more people saw that - because you are good . and it just works out that the movie gets lost . but that s show business .

ESTP	i was hit by a car once on my bike , but i still rode home .
ENTP	fact : the new 90210  is cooler than the old 90210 .  it s the lithe , streamlined skipper to the elder series  venerable barbie . gone are the traditional parents - they have been replaced by a hipster mom n  pop who get busted necking in the car .

ISFP	when i was really little i would sit in the back of my dad s car when he d be playing old-school music . he d turn down the music and turn around and i d be singing and know all of the words but i did not even know how to talk . from then on i have always wanted to be a singer .
ISFJ	before now , i have always taken my mixes out to the car and listened to them in the parking lot . i still do that , but more so now i am listening to it on the beat box , and i think people should give it at least a listen and check it out and see what it is .

ENFJ	no matter how many modern parts i do , people still refer to me as mrs. costume drama . fight club is a studio pic , and i have done very few of those . i have got a feeling it s going to change things for me .
ISFP	it s been really fun to see with each album when i change to see the fans of the show emulate my style and with the first record a lot of the kids in the crowd were wearing neck ties like i was and now you will see a lot of girls with pink hair . it s cool , it s actually really neat .

ISTJ	believe it or not , lots of people change their majors and abandon their dreams just to avoid a couple of math classes in college .
ISTJ	i did not think that college math was for me . i did not think i d be able to hack it . and that perception of math not being for girls , not being for girls who see themselves as socially well adjusted has got to change .
INFJ	all cities do face similar , significant trends in the future ... most importantly global warming and climate change .
INFP	there are people in the world who have the power to change our values .

ISFP	i do not allow anybody to change me . i still walk outta my house in rollers and i take walks . i do not care what people think .

ISTP	there was a great complexity to my father . he was a devoted family man . but , in the same breath , he simply was not suited to an anchored life . he should have been somebody who had a backpack , an old map , a bit of change in his pocket and that was it - roaming the world .
ESFP	i am a role model now . i did not know i was gon na have 13-year-old fans , so i have tried to change a few things here and there . but i also know that the girls do not want me to be miley cyrus , either .
ENTJ	fall is my favorite season in los angeles , watching the birds change color and fall from the trees .
ENTJ	the bush-cheney administration had betrayed some basic american values . so there was hunger for change .
ENTJ	i do genuinely believe that the political system is not linear . when it reaches a tipping point fashioned by a critical mass of opinion , the slow pace of change we are used to will no longer be the norm . i see a lot of signs every day that we are moving closer and closer to that tipping point .
ENFP	a man s character may be learned from the adjectives which he habitually uses in conversation .
ENTJ	i am a great believer that any tool that enhances communication has profound effects in terms of how people can learn from each other , and how they can achieve the kind of freedoms that they are interested in .

ESTP	i learned never to empty the well of my writing , but always to stop when there was still something there in the deep part of the well , and let it refill at night from the springs that fed it .

INTP	a man has a property in his opinions and the free communication of them .
INTJ	the thing that we are trying to do at facebook , is just help people connect and communicate more efficiently .
ENTJ	number one , cash is king ... number two , communicate ... number three , buy or bury the competition .
ENTJ	i think it s fair to say that personal computers have become the most empowering tool we have ever created . they are tools of communication , they are tools of creativity , and they can be shaped by their user .

ENTJ	the strong man is the one who is able to intercept at will the communication between the senses and the mind .
ESTJ	i think we have to face the reality that in a society where there is a legitimate threat of terrorism , not being able to see one s face , not being able to have some sense of communication in that way , is for many societies a challenge .
ESFJ	we shall never be able to remove suspicion and fear as potential causes of war until communication is permitted to flow , free and open , across international boundaries .
ESTP	our most tragic error may have been our inability to establish a rapport and a confidence with the press and television with the communication media . i do not think the press has understood me .
INFJ	the major advances in speed of communication and ability to interact took place more than a century ago . the shift from sailing ships to telegraph was far more radical than that from telephone to email !
INTP	to succeed , you will soon learn , as i did , the importance of a solid foundation in the basics of education - literacy , both verbal and numerical , and communication skills .
INFP	i speak onstage to try to establish some method of communication . the songs are supposed to be a way of communicating . but speech and drinks and sometimes chocolates are also a way of communicating .
INTP	the filmmaking process is a very personal one to me , i mean it really is a personal kind of communication . it s not as though its a study of fear or any of that stuff .

ISFP	i feel like i was writing as i was learning to talk . writing was always a go to form of communication .
ENFP	computers are like old testament gods lots of rules and no mercy .
INTJ	i think computer viruses should count as life . i think it says something about human nature that the only form of life we have created so far is purely destructive . we have created life in our own image .
ESFJ	computers make it easier to do a lot of things , but most of the things they make it easier to do do not need to be done .
ENTJ	security is , i would say , our top priority because for all the exciting things you will be able to do with computers - organizing your lives , staying in touch with people , being creative - if we do not solve these security problems , then people will hold back .
INTJ	i do not fear computers . i fear the lack of them .
INTJ	part of the inhumanity of the computer is that , once it is competently programmed and working smoothly , it is completely honest .

ENTJ	i was afraid of the internet ... because i could not type .

ESFP	bill gates is the pope of the personal computer industry . he decides who s going to build .
ISTP	computers themselves , and software yet to be developed , will revolutionize the way we learn .
ISTP	we are going to be able to ask our computers to monitor things for us , and when certain conditions happen , are triggered , the computers will take certain actions and inform us after the fact .
ISTP	this is what customers pay us for - to sweat all these details so it s easy and pleasant for them to use our computers . we are supposed to be really good at this . that does not mean we do not listen to customers , but it s hard for them to tell you what they want when they have never seen anything remotely like it .
INTJ	i just think people have a lot of fiction . but , you know , i mean , the real story of facebook is just that we have worked so hard for all this time . i mean , the real story is actually probably pretty boring , right ? i mean , we just sat at our computers for six years and coded .
INTJ	there is no heaven or afterlife for broken-down computers that is a fairy story for people afraid of the dark .
INTJ	there is a real danger that computers will develop intelligence and take over . we urgently need to develop direct connections to the brain so that computers can add to human intelligence rather than be in opposition .
ISFJ	globalization , as defined by rich people like us , is a very nice thing ... you are talking about the internet , you are talking about cell phones , you are talking about computers . this does not affect two-thirds of the people of the world .

ESFJ	being cool is being your own self , not doing something that someone else is telling you to do .
ESFP	i am not the kind of person who tries to be cool or trendy , i am definitely an individual .
INFP	it seems like once people grow up , they have no idea what s cool .

INTJ	i do not think of myself as hot or cool or anything , just a dork .

ISFP	i am doing everything that i can , working with experts , really studying the statistics to figure out a way we can make it cool or normal to be kind and loving .
ISTP	what people do not understand is joining a gang ai not bad , it s cool , it s fine . when you in the hood , joining a gang it s cool because all your friends are in the gang , all your family s in the gang . we are not just killing people every night , we are just hanging out , having a good time .
ISFP	where i come from it was really unheard of to be at a party and someone says , what kind of music do you make ?  , and you say , pop music .  you may as well have i am not cool  stamped on your forehead .
INTJ	racism is taught in the home . we agree on that ? well , it s very hard to teach racism to a teenager who s listening to rap music and who idolizes , say , snoop dogg . it s hard to say , that guy is less than you .  the kid is like , i like that guy , he s cool . how is he less than me ?
ESFP	it s cool when fans spend so much time making things for me . it means a lot .
ESFJ	i do not go to the cool , trendy restaurants . i go to either the holes in the wall or the super-fancy restaurants where there are no cool people .

ISFP	i remember being on film sets when i was younger , and only men got to do the cool action movies . so i thought , maybe i will get to produce one day and get to do cool stuff too ,  which is what happened when we did charlie s angels .  starting my production company was a big turning point for me .

INFP	i did not watch much tv as a kid and i don  t watch it now . i don  t find anything beautiful or unique to the medium , and the only thing you can do on tv that you ca not do in film is make a continuing story - which is so cool !
ISTJ	if a guy is skilled at anything , that s attractive . there s something very primal about that and , sure , it can be as simple as figuring out the tip quickly . it s really cool when a guy tips 20 percent quickly and effortlessly so that when the check comes , he opens it and signs his name and done .
INTJ	my friends are people who like building cool stuff . we always have this joke about people who want to just start companies without making something valuable . there s a lot of that in silicon valley .
ISTP	i really , specifically , love acting , and i think it s a really cool thing to be really indulgent and follow that . i have a lot of ambitions in life , but for the next few years , i just want to be an actor . that s a lucky opportunity , and that drives me to want to be good at that .

INFJ	cynicism is kind of like folding your arms and stepping back and commenting on things , like the old guys in the muppets ,  just throwing out comments all the time , whereas there are other people on the ground really trying to affect things and improve their lives and the lives of other people . i think it s noble and i think it s cool .

ISTP	how serious can a movie about time-traveling robots be ? you want it to be cool and fun .
INFP	australia is so cool that it s hard to even know where to start describing it . the beaches are beautiful so is the weather . not too crowded . great food , great music , really nice people . it must be a lot like los angeles was many years ago .
ISFP	justin timberlake is everything , and what more could you want in a person ? he s funny . he s cute . he s great . he just understands . i get him and he gets me , and that s cool .
INFP	it s hard to encapsulate my inspiration because there are so many different looks , but i think it s just like , sexy girl you see walking down the street in a cool outfit . a lot of eyelet , a lot of leather , playing with the hard and the soft , the good and bad inside of us all .

ESFJ	in my teens , i was never part of the cool crowd .

ISFP	personally , i was never the cool kid . i was always sort of a bookworm .
ISFP	spider-man s probably my favorite . you see , batman is a billionaire and there s nothing really cool about a billionaire saving the world . but spider-man is peter parker , a conflicted character who puts on a suit and saves the world . i love that .
INFJ	my whole thing is that i want to explore why you read books , what s the purpose of reading , and maybe that it s not that cool to hate something just because it s popular .

INTJ	you make your first album , you make some money , and you feel like you still have to show face , like i still go to the projects .  i am like , why ? your job is to inspire people from your neighborhood to get out . you grew up there . what makes you think it s so cool ?
INTP	most of the time you are too busy to think about it . but every now and then you say , i work at saturday night live ,  and that is so cool .
ISFP	i wanted to escape small town u.s.a. to dismiss the boundaries , to explore . my life experience came from watching movies , tv , and reading books and magazines . when your culture comes from watching tv everyday , you are bombarded with images of things that seem cool , places that seem interesting , people who have jobs and careers and opportunities .
ENFP	but acting is very much a profession that is you are hot one moment and not the next - and that is totally cool . i think that s what i find most fascinating and most exciting about it - is that it can be gone in a puff of smoke .

ESFJ	you have to be the best of whatever you are , but successful , cool actresses come in all shapes and sizes .

ESTP	you do not develop courage by being happy in your relationships everyday . you develop it by surviving difficult times and challenging adversity .
ESFP	above all , we must realize that no arsenal , or no weapon in the arsenals of the world , is so formidable as the will and moral courage of free men and women . it is a weapon our adversaries in today s world do not have .
ENFP	it is curious that physical courage should be so common in the world and moral courage so rare .
ESTP	courage is rightly esteemed the first of human qualities ... because it is the quality which guarantees all others .
ESFP	a nation which has forgotten the quality of courage which in the past has been brought to public life is not as likely to insist upon or regard that quality in its chosen leaders today - and in fact we have forgotten .
ENFP	do you really think it is weakness that yields to temptation ? i tell you that there are terrible temptations which it requires strength , strength and courage to yield to .
ESFP	the courage of life is often a less dramatic spectacle than the courage of a final moment but it is no less a magnificent mixture of triumph and tragedy .
ENTJ	courage is the first of human qualities because it is the quality which guarantees the others .

ISFJ	i always wanted what mom and dad had .
ENFP	my dad is still christian scientist . my mom s not , and i am not . but i believe in god , and that there s a higher power and an intelligence that s bigger than us and that we can rely on . it s not just us , thinking we are the ones in control of everything . that idea gives me support .

ISTJ	i grew up in a small town in illinois , and my dad was a basketball coach . thanks to him , i have excellent fundamentals in both basketball and baseball .

ESFP	real magic in relationships means an absence of judgment of others .
ESTP	i am not the girl who always has a boyfriend . i am the girl who rarely has a boyfriend .
ESTP	i like the bad-boy types . generally the guy i am attracted to is the guy in the club with all the tattoos and nail polish . he s usually the lead singer in a punk band and plays guitar . but my serious boyfriends are relatively clean-cut , nice guys . so it s strange .
ESTP	there s only two people in your life you should lie to ... the police and your girlfriend .
ISTJ	smart women love smart men more than smart men love smart women .
ESFJ	do not just look at your boyfriend as just a boyfriend . look at him as a friend , too .
ISFP	right now i am pretty single ... my career is my boyfriend .
ENFP	you know when i feel inwardly beautiful ? when i am with my girlfriends and we are having a goddess circle  .
ENTP	i used to be a real prince charming if i went on a date with a girl . but then i d get to where i was likely to have a stroke from the stress of keeping up my act . i have since learned the key to a good date is to pay attention on her .
ESTP	well , a girlfriend once told me never to fight with anybody you do not love .
ISFP	i do not understand the whole dating thing . i know right off the bat if i am interested in someone , and i do not want them to waste their money on me and take me out to eat if i know i am not interested in that person .
ESTJ	everything i buy is vintage and smells funny . maybe that s why i do not have a boyfriend .
ESFP	i have never been romeo who meets a girl and falls for her immediately . it s been a much slower process for me each time i have gone into a relationship .

ESFP	i always say now that i am in my blonde years . because since the end of my marriage , all of my girlfriends have been blonde .
ESTP	rumors about me ? calista flockhart , pam anderson , and matt damon . that s who i am dating .
ESFJ	i have stepped off the relationship scene to come to terms with myself . i have spent most of my adult life being someone s girlfriend  , and now i am happy being single .
ISTP	the prospect of dating someone in her twenties becomes less appealing as you get older . at some point in your fife , your tolerance level goes down and you realize that , with someone much younger , there s nothing really to talk about .
ESFP	i prefer ordinary girls - you know , college students , waitresses , that sort of thing . most of the girls i go out with are just good friends . just because i go out to the cinema with a girl , it does not mean we are dating .
ESFJ	my philosophy of dating is to just fart right away .
INFP	i ca not even explain to you how terrible that feels , that i equate dating a woman with punishment , shame , guilt , disappointment , reproach , reprimand , persecution . it s a nightmare .
ESTJ	when i started dating i had this kind of romeo and juliet , fateful romantic idea about love which was almost that you were a victim and there was a lot of pain involved and that was how it should be .
ISTP	people say , just say who you are dating . then people will stop being so ravenous about it .  it s like , no they wo not ! they will ask for specifics .
ISTP	i would not tell you anything about anybody i cared about because it becomes entertainment for other people , and it sort of just cheapens everything in your life . i would never tell you if i was dating anybody .
ESFJ	i am not very experienced with boys or the whole dating thingy .
ESTP	i am much more interested in what an actor has to say about something substantial and important than who they are dating or what clothes they are wearing or some other asinine , insignificant aspect of their life .

ENTP	i saw few die of hunger of eating , a hundred thousand .
ENTJ	death will be a great relief . no more interviews .

ESTP	it is possible to provide security against other ills , but as far as death is concerned , we men live in a city without walls .
ENTP	i do not agree with what you have to say , but i will defend to the death your right to say it .
ENFJ	a nation or civilization that continues to produce soft-minded men purchases its own spiritual death on the installment plan .
INFP	people fear death even more than pain . it s strange that they fear death . life hurts a lot more than death . at the point of death , the pain is over . yeah , i guess it is a friend .

INFP	cowards die many times before their deaths the valiant never taste of death but once .
ISTP	remembering that i will be dead soon is the most important tool i have ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life . because almost everything - all external expectations , all pride , all fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death , leaving only what is truly important .

ISTJ	there s no tragedy in life like the death of a child . things never get back to the way they were .
ENFP	i am completely in favor of the separation of church and state . my idea is that these two institutions screw us up enough on their own , so both of them together is certain death .

INFP	death makes angels of us all and gives us wings where we had shoulders smooth as ravens claws .
ENFP	life is a process of becoming , a combination of states we have to go through . where people fail is that they wish to elect a state and remain in it . this is a kind of death .
ENFP	love never dies a natural death . it dies because we do not know how to replenish it s source . it dies of blindness and errors and betrayals . it dies of illness and wounds it dies of weariness , of witherings , of tarnishings .
INFP	death is a fearful thing .
INFP	the stroke of death is as a lover s pinch , which hurts and is desired .

ENFP	in spite of everything i still believe that people are really good at heart . i simply ca not build up my hopes on a foundation consisting of confusion , misery and death .
ENTJ	to run away from trouble is a form of cowardice and , while it is true that the suicide braves death , he does it not for some noble object but to escape some ill .

ISFJ	i am running for president to help create a better future . a future where everyone who wants a job can find one . where no senior fears for the security of their retirement . an america where every parent knows that their child will get an education that leads them to a good job and a bright horizon .
ENFP	the most valuable of all education is the ability to make yourself do the thing you have to do , when it has to be done , whether you like it or not .
ESTJ	there are 4 billion cell phones in use today . many of them are in the hands of market vendors , rickshaw drivers , and others who have historically lacked access to education and opportunity . information networks have become a great leveler , and we should use them together to help lift people out of poverty and give them a freedom from want .
INTJ	self-education is , i firmly believe , the only kind of education there is .
ENTJ	as people do better , they start voting like republicans - unless they have too much education and vote democratic , which proves there can be too much of a good thing .
ESTP	no group and no government can properly prescribe precisely what should constitute the body of knowledge with which true education is concerned .
ESTJ	let s not leave an educational vacuum to be filled by religious extremists who go to families who have no other option and offer meals , housing and some form of education . if we are going to combat extremism then we must educate those very same children .
ESTP	without education , you are not going anywhere in this world .
ESTJ	i feel very lucky because of my parents and then my education , the opportunities that i have had , so i would like to continue working to improve lives for others .
INFP	i doubt whether classical education ever has been or can be successfully carried out without corporal punishment .
ENTP	education is the cheap defense of nations .
ISTP	his lack of education is more than compensated for by his keenly developed moral bankruptcy .
INTP	education begins the gentleman , but reading , good company and reflection must finish him .
INTP	whenever a youth is ascertained to possess talents meriting an education which his parents can not afford , he should be carried forward at the public expense .
ESFJ	upon books the collective education of the race depends they are the sole instruments of registering , perpetuating and transmitting thought .
INFP	we are born weak , we need strength helpless , we need aid foolish , we need reason . all that we lack at birth , all that we need when we come to man s estate , is the gift of education .
ISFJ	the education of a man is never completed until he dies .
INTJ	you know , nothing is more important than education , because nowhere are our stakes higher our future depends on the quality of education of our children today .
ENTP	there is a subconscious way of taking violence as a way of expression , as a normality , and it has a lot of effects in the youth in the way they absorb education and what they hope to get out of life .
INTP	segregation has no place in the education system .
INTJ	i am a big believer in education , because when i grew up in austria - when i grew up in austria i had a great education . i had great teachers .
ESTP	education is not a problem . education is an opportunity .
INTP	men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story . education has been theirs in so much higher a degree the pen has been in their hands . i will not allow books to prove anything .
ESTP	until justice is blind to color , until education is unaware of race , until opportunity is unconcerned with the color of men s skins , emancipation will be a proclamation but not a fact .
INFP	if we help an educated man s daughter to go to cambridge are we not forcing her to think not about education but about war ? - not how she can learn , but how she can fight in order that she might win the same advantages as her brothers ?
ESTP	only a liberal senator from massachusetts would say that a 49 percent increase in funding for education was not enough .
ESTJ	see , that s why barack s running : to end the war in iraq responsibly - to build an economy that lifts every family , to make sure health care is available for every american - and to make sure that every child in this nation has a world-class education all the way from preschool to college .
ESFJ	inclusive , good-quality education is a foundation for dynamic and equitable societies .
ESTJ	i know what it feels like to struggle to get the education that you need .
ESFP	documentaries are the first line of education , and the second line of education is dramatization , such as the pacific  .
ESFJ	universal education is not only a moral imperative but an economic necessity , to pave the way toward making many more nations self-sufficient and self-sustaining .
INTJ	education : the inculcation of the incomprehensible into the indifferent by the incompetent .
INTJ	my children , to the extent that they have found religion , have found it from me , in that i insist on at least a modicum of religious education for them .
INFP	do i dare set forth here the most important , the most useful rule of all education ? it is not to save time , but to squander it .
ESTJ	until we get equality in education , we wo not have an equal society .
INFJ	the internet could be a very positive step towards education , organisation and participation in a meaningful society .
ESFJ	those outside of autism need to understand this is an epidemic and we need more government funding , insurance coverage and education reform .
INTJ	we have not given science too big a place in our education , but we have made a perilous mistake in giving it too great a preponderance in method in every other branch of study .
ESTP	you ca not legislate good will - that comes through education .
ESFJ	my father is a real idealist , and he s all about learning . if i asked for a pair of nikes growing up , it was just a resounding no .  but if i asked for a saxophone , one would appear and next day and i d be signed up for lessons . so anything to do with education or learning , my father would spare no expense .
ESTP	i have never been a big believer in formal education .
ENTP	there is not to be found , in all history , any miracle attested by a sufficient number of men , of such unquestioned good sense , education and learning , as to secure us against all delusion in themselves .
ESTJ	i have felt for the last 10 years i have had this battle i have been fighting so hard to have an education . it s been this uphill struggle . i was warner bros  pain in the butt . i was their scheduling conflict . i was the one who made life difficult .
ISTJ	i recognize that i have a unique position to be a role model to young girls because i am doing something that they consider glamorous , which is acting , and yet i took a time to really get my education and study mathematics , and i think math is the cat s meow .
ISTJ	i had done quite a bit of research about math education when i spoke before congress in 2000 about the importance of women in mathematics . the session of congress was all about raising more scholarships for girls in college . i told them i felt that it s too late by college .
ISTJ	what i got which was unusual , especially as a child actress , was parents who believed that hollywood was not that important . they told us education , family , health , all come first and they meant it .
INFJ	i had never done anything with blue screen before , or prosthetics , or anything like that . lord of the rings was like stepping into a videogame for me . it was another world completely . but , to be honest , i basically did it so that i could have the ears . i thought they would really work with my bare head.working with martin scorsese was an absolute minute-by-minute education without him ever being grandiose about it .
ENFJ	my hope was that organizations would start including this range of skills in their training programs - in other words , offer an adult education in social and emotional intelligence .
ENFJ	education is the best economic policy there is .
ENTJ	i pledge to you today that as president , in my first budget , i will introduce the largest increase in special education ever .
ENTJ	furthermore , we believe that health care reform , again i said at the beginning of my remarks , that we sent the three pillars that the president s economic stabilization and job creation initiatives were education and innovation - innovation begins in the classroom - clean energy and climate , addressing the climate issues in an innovative way to keep us number one and competitive in the world with the new technology , and the third , first among equals i may say , is health care , health insurance reform .
INTP	more particularly , having a largely german-oriented education has made me very responsive to 19th-century german literature .
ESFJ	one of the things that s great about new york is that it is not a one-industry town . it has education , academia , the service industry , arts , publishing , theater , politics , fashion , finance , as well as movie-making .
ESFJ	my parents came from a poor background and worked their way up because of education . they saw it as a way to succeed . so they cared about me getting straight a grades when i was growing up .
ESFJ	we all have a responsibility to volunteer somewhere and i am lucky that i get the education and get taken to places to see what s out there and see what s happening and to then be a part of it in hopefully an impactful way .
ESFJ	my mom was really vigorous about making sure that we saw things and that we questioned things . education was so important to both of my parents .
ISTJ	i feel sorry sometimes for these sportsmen and women who put in just as much effort as the footballers . for example , athletes train at least as hard as footballers but have to be happy if they can earn enough to finance a decent education .
ESFJ	the government has convinced parents that at some point it s no longer their responsibility . and in fact , they force them , in many respects , to turn their children over to the public education system and wrest control from them and block them out of participation of that . that has to change or education will not improve in this country .
ENFJ	capitalism would have never let me be a filmmaker , living in flint , michigan with a high school education . i was going to have to make that happen myself .
INFJ	the value of a good education has never left me .
ISTJ	my mother is a professor of early childhood education . when i was two she would say she knew i was going to be an actor .
ESFJ	the obama administration now has regulations that tells them that they can no longer promote marriage to these young girls . they can no longer promote marriage as a way of avoiding poverty and bad choices that they make in their life . they can no longer even teach abstinence education . they have to be neutral with respect to how people behave .
ESFJ	i also found that for myself , since i have had no religious education , it was so interesting to see the different versions of heaven and what life on earth means .
INTP	the environment is everything that is not me .
ENTJ	i think the cost of energy will come down when we make this transition to renewable energy .
ENTJ	our world faces a true planetary emergency . i know the phrase sounds shrill , and i know it s a challenge to the moral imagination .
ESFP	if the federal government had been around when the creator was putting his hand to this state , indiana would not be here . it d still be waiting for an environmental impact statement .
INTJ	i have a private plane . but i fly commercial when i go to environmental conferences .
INFJ	there are two problems for our species  survival - nuclear war and environmental catastrophe - and we are hurtling towards them . knowingly .
ISFJ	i have used the prestige and influence of having been a president of the united states as effectively as possible . and secondly , i have still been able to carry out my commitments to peace and human rights and environmental quality and freedom and democracy and so forth .
ENFJ	this is absolutely bizarre that we continue to subsidize highways beyond the gasoline tax , airlines , and we do not subsidize , we do not want to subsidize a national rail system that has environmental impact .
ENTJ	i took the initiative in moving forward a whole range of initiatives that have proven to be important to our country s economic growth , environmental protection , improvements in our educational system .
ESFP	raising awareness on the most pressing environmental issues of our time is more important than ever .
ENFJ	the industrial processes in use today were developed at a time when no one had to consider what the environmental impact was . who cared ? but making ecological concerns matter to a company s bottom line will help it do the research and development that will reinvent everything we buy .
ENFJ	i have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin , but by the content of their character .
INTP	before god we are all equally wise - and equally foolish .
ENFJ	i have a dream that one day on the red hills of georgia , the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit together at the table of brotherhood .
ENFJ	the sweltering summer of the negro s legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality .
INTP	fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent , a new nation , conceived in liberty , and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal .
INTP	these men ask for just the same thing , fairness , and fairness only . this , so far as in my power , they , and all others , shall have .
INFJ	i believe in equality for everyone , except reporters and photographers .
ISFP	all this talk about equality . the only thing people really have in common is that they are all going to die .
ENTP	in america everybody is of the opinion that he has no social superiors , since all men are equal , but he does not admit that he has no social inferiors , for , from the time of jefferson onward , the doctrine that all men are equal applies only upwards , not downwards .
ISFJ	racism is still with us . but it is up to us to prepare our children for what they have to meet , and , hopefully , we shall overcome .
ESTP	the wisdom of man never yet contrived a system of taxation that would operate with perfect equality .
ENTJ	the battle for women s rights has been largely won .
ENFP	the year was 2081 , and everyone was finally equal .
INTJ	there can be no equality or opportunity if men and women and children be not shielded in their lives from the consequences of great industrial and social processes which they can not alter , control , or singly cope with .
INFJ	virtue can only flourish among equals .
ESTP	nobody can give you freedom . nobody can give you equality or justice or anything . if you are a man , you take it .
ENFP	here are the values that i stand for : honesty , equality , kindness , compassion , treating people the way you want to be treated and helping those in need . to me , those are traditional values .
ENTP	with patient and firm determination , i am going to press on for jobs . i am going to press on for equality . i am going to press on for the sake of our children . i am going to press on for the sake of all those families who are struggling right now . i do not have time to feel sorry for myself . i do not have time to complain . i am going to press on .
ENFJ	just as modern mass production requires the standardization of commodities , so the social process requires standardization of man , and this standardization is called equality .
INFP	no advance in wealth , no softening of manners , no reform or revolution has ever brought human equality a millimeter nearer .
ENFJ	you see , africa makes a fool of our idea of justice . it makes a farce of our idea of equality . it mocks our pieties . it doubts our concern . it questions our commitment . because there is no way we can look at what s happening in africa , and if we are honest , conclude that it would ever be allowed to happen anywhere else .
ISFJ	a fundamentalist ca not bring himself or herself to negotiate with people who disagree with them because the negotiating process itself is an indication of implied equality .
ISFJ	i believe there is complete equality between men and women . and i believe those passages in the new testament , not by jesus , but by paul , that say women should not adorn themselves , they should always wear hats or color their hair in church - things like that - i think they are signs of the times and should not apply to modern-day life .
ESFP	for a modern woman it is important to be supported and that there is equality in every aspect , and that it s not two halves that make a whole - it s two wholes that make a whole .
ENFP	ok , in all seriousness , i would say i could not be in a relationship without equality , generosity , integrity , spirit , kindness and humor . and awesomeness .
ENTJ	marriage equality is about more than just marriage . it s about something greater . it s about acceptance .
ENFJ	so what we are talking about here is human rights . the right to live like a human . the right to live , period . and what we are facing in africa is an unprecedented threat to human dignity and equality .
ISTJ	i have always been hopeful about scotland s prospects . and i now believe more than ever that scotland is within touching distance of achieving independence and equality .
ENTJ	for 25 years , it has been my privilege to represent the city of san francisco and the great state of california to work to strengthen our vibrant middle class to secure opportunity and equality .
INFP	feminism is just about equality , really , and there s so much stuff attached to the word , when it s actually so simple . i do not know why it s always so bogged down .
ESFJ	i believe i have always been a big believer in equality . no one has ever been able to tell me i could not do something because i was a girl .
ENFP	feudal societies do not create great cinema we have great theatre . the egalitarian societies create great cinema . the americans , the french . because equality is sort of what the cinema deals with . it deals with stories which do not fall into everybody in their place and who s who ,  and all that . but the theatre s full of that .
INTP	the only source of knowledge is experience .
ENFP	experience is simply the name we give our mistakes .
ENFP	a man who carries a cat by the tail learns something he can learn in no other way .
INTP	it has been my experience that folks who have no vices have very few virtues .
ENFP	experience is one thing you ca not get for nothing .
INFP	you can not create experience . you must undergo it .
INFP	when you have really exhausted an experience you always reverence and love it .
ENTJ	experience is the teacher of all things .
ENFP	experience teaches only the teachable .
INTP	experience without theory is blind , but theory without experience is mere intellectual play .
ENTP	there are many truths of which the full meaning can not be realized until personal experience has brought it home .
ENFP	experience is not what happens to you it s what you do with what happens to you .
INTP	it was the experience of mystery - even if mixed with fear - that engendered religion .
INFJ	experience demands that man is the only animal which devours his own kind , for i can apply no milder term to the general prey of the rich on the poor .
ISTJ	let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion . reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle .
ENFP	i do not believe people are looking for the meaning of life as much as they are looking for the experience of being alive .
ESTJ	if money is your hope for independence you will never have it . the only real security that a man will have in this world is a reserve of knowledge , experience , and ability .
ESFP	beliefs have the power to create and the power to destroy . human beings have the awesome ability to take any experience of their lives and create a meaning that disempowers them or one that can literally save their lives .
ENFJ	never , never and never again shall it be that this beautiful land will again experience the oppression of one by another .
INFP	i had rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad and to travel for it too !
ESFP	be brave . take risks . nothing can substitute experience .
ISTJ	experience teaches us that it is much easier to prevent an enemy from posting themselves than it is to dislodge them after they have got possession .
INFJ	unwearied ceaseless effort is the price that must be paid for turning faith into a rich infallible experience .
ENFJ	i am a woman in process . i am just trying like everybody else . i try to take every conflict , every experience , and learn from it . life is never dull .
ENTP	experience keeps a dear school , but fools will learn in no other .
ISFP	fame will go by and , so long , i have had you , fame . if it goes by , i have always known it was fickle . so at least it s something i experience , but that s not where i live .
ISFP	i probably hold the distinction of being one movie star who , by all laws of logic , should never have made it . at each stage of my career , i lacked the experience .
ISTP	sex without love is a meaningless experience , but as far as meaningless experiences go its pretty damn good .
INTJ	experience , as a desire for experience , does not come off . we must not study ourselves while having an experience .
INTJ	to use the same words is not a sufficient guarantee of understanding one must use the same words for the same genus of inward experience ultimately one must have one s experiences in common .
INFP	experience has shown , and a true philosophy will always show , that a vast , perhaps the larger portion of the truth arises from the seemingly irrelevant .
ENFP	what each must seek in his life never was on land or sea . it is something out of his own unique potentiality for experience , something that never has been and never could have been experienced by anyone else .
ESFP	only those who have learned the power of sincere and selfless contribution experience life s deepest joy : true fulfillment .
ISTJ	we should not look back unless it is to derive useful lessons from past errors , and for the purpose of profiting by dearly bought experience .
ENFP	i do not have to have faith , i have experience .
ISTJ	there can be no greater error than to expect , or calculate , upon real favors from nation to nation . it is an illusion which experience must cure , which a just pride ought to discard .
ENTP	is there anyone so wise as to learn by the experience of others ?
ISTP	our dna is as a consumer company - for that individual customer who s voting thumbs up or thumbs down . that s who we think about . and we think that our job is to take responsibility for the complete user experience . and if it s not up to par , it s our fault , plain and simply .
ISTJ	i have found little that is good  about human beings on the whole . in my experience most of them are trash , no matter whether they publicly subscribe to this or that ethical doctrine or to none at all . that is something that you can not say aloud , or perhaps even think .
ISTP	i do not think i have ever worked so hard on something , but working on macintosh was the neatest experience of my life . almost everyone who worked on it will say that . none of us wanted to release it at the end . it was as though we knew that once it was out of our hands , it would not be ours anymore .
ESFP	take control of your consistent emotions and begin to consciously and deliberately reshape your daily experience of life .
ISFP	you learn from a conglomeration of the incredible past - whatever experience gotten in any way whatsoever .
ESTJ	the only real security that a man can have in this world is a reserve of knowledge , experience and ability .
ESTP	you have people come into your life shockingly and surprisingly . you have losses that you never thought you d experience . you have rejection and you have learn how to deal with that and how to get up the next day and go on with it .
ENTJ	dos is ugly and interferes with users  experience .
INFP	it s good to experience hollywood in short bursts , i guess . little snippets . i do not think i can handle being here all the time , it s pretty nutty .
ISTJ	knowledge comes , but wisdom lingers . it may not be difficult to store up in the mind a vast quantity of facts within a comparatively short time , but the ability to form judgments requires the severe discipline of hard work and the tempering heat of experience and maturity .
ENFP	how is it possible that a being with such sensitive jewels as the eyes , such enchanted musical instruments as the ears , and such fabulous arabesque of nerves as the brain can experience itself anything less than a god .
INTJ	experience praises the most happy the one who made the most people happy .
ENFP	from their experience or from the recorded experience of others ( history ) , men learn only what their passions and their metaphysical prejudices allow them to learn .
ESTJ	going out and playing football or baseball with the boys , when i was a tomboy , was a great way to learn about winning and losing , and most girls did not have that experience .
ISTJ	when people speak to you about a preventive war , you tell them to go and fight it . after my experience , i have come to hate war .
ENTP	taste every fruit of every tree in the garden at least once . it is an insult to creation not to experience it fully . temperance is wickedness .
ESFJ	my own experience is use the tools that are out there . use the digital world . but never lose sight of the need to reach out and talk to other people who do not share your view . listen to them and see if you can find a way to compromise .
INTP	screaming at children over their grades , especially to the point of the child s tears , is child abuse , pure and simple . it s not funny and it s not good parenting . it is a crushing , scarring , disastrous experience for the child . it is not the least bit funny .
INFP	every secret of a writer s soul , every experience of his life , every quality of his mind is written large in his works .
ISTJ	the act of birth is the first experience of anxiety , and thus the source and prototype of the affect of anxiety .
ENTP	in the revolt against idealism , the ambiguities of the word experience have been perceived , with the result that realists have more and more avoided the word .
ENTP	life has a certain flavor for those who have fought and risked all that the sheltered and protected can never experience .
ESFJ	experience has shown how deeply the seeds of war are planted by economic rivalry and social injustice .
INFP	what is the price of experience ? do men buy it for a song ? or wisdom for a dance in the street ? no , it is bought with the price of all the man hath , his house , his wife , his children .
INTP	no man s knowledge here can go beyond his experience .
ESFJ	the reward of suffering is experience .
ESFP	the physical world , including our bodies , is a response of the observer . we create our bodies as we create the experience of our world .
INTJ	acting is a question of absorbing other people s personalities and adding some of your own experience .
INTP	the only relevant test of the validity of a hypothesis is comparison of prediction with experience .
INTP	it is beyond a doubt that all our knowledge that begins with experience .
INTP	but perhaps the rest of us could have separate classes in science appreciation , the wonder of science , scientific ways of thinking , and the history of scientific ideas , rather than laboratory experience .
ENFJ	no experience is a cause of success or failure . we do not suffer from the shock of our experiences , so-called trauma - but we make out of them just what suits our purposes .
INTJ	you can not , in human experience , rush into the light . you have to go through the twilight into the broadening day before the noon comes and the full sun is upon the landscape .
ISFJ	i do not claim to be knowledgeable about theology . most of my knowledge comes out of my experience and the lessons in the bible . every sunday i am home i teach 45 minutes and we boiled them down to one page for the new book , through the year with jimmy carter . 
INFP	masterpieces are not single and solitary births they are the outcome of many years of thinking in common , of thinking by the body of the people , so that the experience of the mass is behind the single voice .
INTP	but although all our knowledge begins with experience , it does not follow that it arises from experience .
INTJ	to choose  dogma and faith over doubt and experience is to throw out the ripening vintage and to reach greedily for the kool-aid .
ESFJ	i maybe had a first love and had my heart broken , but reflecting on it , i do not think that was love . i think as i am getting older and having more in-depth relationships , maybe i will experience it . at the moment , i do not know , exactly , if i have been in love .
ISFP	yes , i have been trepanned . that s quite an interesting experience , especially for my brain surgeon , who saw my thoughts flying around in my brain .
ESTP	there is no more lively sensation than that of pain its impressions are certain and dependable , they never deceive as may those of the pleasure women perpetually feign and almost never experience .
ENTP	the dictum that truth always triumphs over persecution is one of the pleasant falsehoods which men repeat after one another till they pass into commonplaces , but which all experience refutes .
ISFP	it would be my guess that madonna is not a very happy woman . from my own experience , having gone through persona changes like that , that kind of clawing need to be the center of attention is not a pleasant place to be .
ENTP	imagine a judicial nominee said my experience as a white man makes me better than a latina woman .  would not they have to withdraw ? new racism is no better than old racism .
INFP	the experience of life consists of the experience which the spirit has of itself in matter and as matter , in mind and as mind , in emotion , as emotion , etc .
ESTJ	but it s a journey and the sad thing is you only learn from experience , so as much as someone can tell you things , you have to go out there and make your own mistakes in order to learn .
ENTP	of two pleasures , if there be one which all or almost all who have experience of both give a decided preference , irrespective of any feeling of moral obligation to prefer it , that is the more desirable pleasure .
ISFP	i never intended for the monster ball to be a religious experience , it just became one .
ENFP	i am not one aspect of the human experience - none of us is .
INFP	talking with you is sort of the conversational equivalent of an out of body experience .
ISTJ	if you do build a great experience , customers tell each other about that . word of mouth is very powerful .
ENTP	this has been a learning experience for me . i also thought that privacy was something we were granted in the constitution . i have learned from this when in fact the word privacy does not appear in the constitution .
ISFJ	the experience of democracy is like the experience of life itself-always changing , infinite in its variety , sometimes turbulent and all the more valuable for having been tested by adversity .
ESTP	sure , i suffered a lot . but it s not like the end of the world and it s not who i am . i lead quite a pleasant life and i am able to divorce a perceived reality from my actual experience of life .
ESFJ	parents of recovered children , and i have met hundreds , all share the same experience of doubters and deniers telling us our child must have never even had autism or that the recovery was simply nature s course . we all know better , and frankly we are too busy helping other parents to really care .
ESFP	i do not care how smart a kid you are . the only way you learn what s not right is from experience .
INTP	poets are the only people to whom love is not only a crucial , but an indispensable experience , which entitles them to mistake it for a universal one .
ISFJ	the amount of meetings i have been in - people would be shocked . but that s how you gain experience , how you can gain knowledge , being in meetings and participating . you learn and grow .
ENFP	i would love to work in america . i would not love to live there , but i d love to experience working there .
ENFP	i had one relative who passed away but fortunately none others . so my sort of experience of it is quite limited , thankfully .
ESTJ	as the leader of twelve apostles , even jesus had more executive experience than obama .
INFP	if we did not want to upset anyone , we would make films about sewing , but even that could be dangerous . but i think finally , in a film , it is how the balance is and the feelings are . but i think there has to be those contrasts and strong things within a film for the total experience .
INFJ	i would wish for any one of my colleagues to have the experience of working with martin scorsese once in their lifetime .
ENFP	it s my experience that you really ca not lose when you try the truth .
ISTJ	going to a party , for me , is as much a learning experience as , you know , sitting in a lecture .
INFP	sometimes i get so bold and i am so confident about what i am doing that i actually try to be more of a dork because it s a really liberating feeling to experience what it s like to not care .
ENFJ	the deeper the experience of an absence of meaning - in other words , of absurdity - the more energetically meaning is sought .
ENTP	experience is what you get while looking for something else .
ESTJ	whether born from experience or inherent physiological or cultural differences our gender and national origins may and will make a difference in our judging .
ENTP	i had the experience last year of directing my first feature while i had a 1-year-old son and while i was also pregnant , so i am now well aware of the difficulties women who are rearing children face when they are also trying to make headway in mainstream of film .
ENTP	you know , it should not just be about women as heroic figures overcoming things , it just needs to be about women in general getting the opportunity to play a multitude of roles , telling a multitude of stories - just to express human experience from a woman s perspective . i hope , someday , we can get to that point . i am all about representation .
ENTP	there s probably no experience more alienating than fame , other than a terminal illness , where you actually find yourself in a situation that nobody around you can relate to .
ENTP	one nice thing about being a woman in hollywood is that the women tend to be very close-knit . all of us writers and directors know each other and cling to each other for safety and support , and it s really a completely different vibe than the men experience out here , where they are all trying to murder each other .
ESFP	so i have seen life as one long learning process . and if i see - you know , if i fly on somebody else s airline and find the experience is not a pleasant one , which it was not in - 21 years ago , then i d think , well , you know , maybe i can create the kind of airline that i d like to fly on .
ISTP	i just think that the collective experience of going to see a film is something you ca not recreate .
INFJ	i discovered early on that some performers live their life in order to act , so all their relationships are simply an experience that they can feed back into their work . which i find vampiric .
INFJ	if you have got a piece and you can feel the person who s going to direct it is really made for it , if it s really special for them , then it s going to be a better-than-usual experience .
ISFJ	obviously an actor draws on his own experience .
ENTP	i really do love diana ross i grew up listening to her records . i grew up in a little town in mexico , so while we got the music , we never got the experience of watching her .
INTP	the monsters of our childhood do not fade away , neither are they ever wholly monstrous . but neither , in my experience , do we ever reach a plane of detachment regarding our parents , however wise and old we may become . to pretend otherwise is to cheat .
INTP	a spy , like a writer , lives outside the mainstream population . he steals his experience through bribes and reconstructs it .
ISTJ	we see our customers as invited guests to a party , and we are the hosts . it s our job every day to make every important aspect of the customer experience a little bit better .
ISTJ	prudence is but experience , which equal time , equally bestows on all men , in those things they equally apply themselves unto .
ESFJ	when you go to the movies with your whole family , it s a different experience . for some reason , it s something that you are all doing together and you take away something special in that .
ESTJ	all of the legal defense funds out there , they are looking for people out there with court of appeals experience , because court of appeals is where policy is made . and i know , i know this is on tape and i should never say that because we do not make law , i know . i know .
ISTP	i have relationships with people i am working with , based on our combined interest . it does not make the relationship any less sincere , but it does give it a focus that may not last beyond the experience .
ISFP	every day is a new experience and i take it as it comes .
INFJ	i am not particularly precious about the theatrical experience any more .
INFJ	a lot of why i do something is just the novelty of the experience .
INFP	you can live your whole life in your brain and not experience what s around you . you go crazy that way .
ISFJ	i would not say i am a very original thinker , but if i have a good experience with something , i will want to take it further or adapt it in some way .
INTP	i was quite able at the insignificant work i did in mi6 , but absolutely dysfunctional in my domestic life . i had no experience of fatherhood . i had no example of marital bliss or the family unit .
ESTJ	i learn from experience .
ISTP	i have the ordinary experience of being anonymous when i am in an airplane talking to air-traffic control , and they do not know who they are talking to . i have a lot of common experiences .
ESFJ	i definitely feel more complete than before . there s a void you have when you do not feel you have found the other part of who you are , so i am in a different place now and that s nice to experience .
INTJ	while i was trying to save money to go to the national institute of dramatic art in australia i ended up getting all of this experience which meant that by the time i had enough money in the bank to go to school i did not really need to go to school anymore .
ENFP	i think experience will teach you a combination of liberalism and conservatism . we have to be progressive and at the same time we have to retain values . we have to hold onto the past as we explore the future .
ENFP	i would vote for the man who s lived life , who s done different occupations , who s been out in the real world and struggled to make a living , struggled to raise a family , struggled with life as it exists . so i d vote for experience , honest experience .
ENFP	there are more people than you think who want to have a challenging experience , in which they are obliged to reflect about the past .
INFJ	i think that the mark of a great book is that it will meet you wherever you are at and you will feel and experience something new and different each time you read it .
INFJ	well , i stopped drinking . that was actually a big deal . i did not go through any harrowing rock-bottom experience . i just made a decision to stop drinking .
ESFP	i think most artists will experience a lot of negative people on twitter but , thank god , i have got so many followers that i am not able to see them that much . i will see some from time to time but , for the most part , i always focus on something good .
INFP	i have had a great experience with pretty much everybody i have worked with .
ISTJ	from this experience we have learned that in a big party it is important to have the necessary and often controversial discussions on policy issues such as the health system while in opposition .
ENTP	but i just know from experience that accent wise , even if you are an accent genius , crossing the atlantic is the hardest thing in the world either way .
ISFJ	on the one hand , we will never experience childbirth . on the other hand , we can open all our own jars .
INFJ	my advice would be to write what is most personal and specific to your experience or your life . and your voice will emerge and because of its specificity , it will be universal .
ESFJ	i will perform my heart will go on for the rest of my life and it will always remain a very emotional experience for me .
ISFP	i love music , and after my first experience with movies , i ca not wait to do more .
ESTP	far better is it to dare mighty things , to win glorious triumphs , even though checkered by failure ... than to rank with those poor spirits who neither enjoy nor suffer much , because they live in a gray twilight that knows not victory nor defeat .
INTP	my great concern is not whether you have failed , but whether you are content with your failure .
ESFP	i have come to believe that all my past failure and frustration were actually laying the foundation for the understandings that have created the new level of living i now enjoy .
ENTP	do not fear mistakes . you will know failure . continue to reach out .
ENTJ	it s fine to celebrate success but it is more important to heed the lessons of failure .
ENFP	ambition is the last refuge of the failure .
ESFJ	success is the result of perfection , hard work , learning from failure , loyalty , and persistence .
ENFJ	i do not believe in failure . it is not failure if you enjoyed the process .
ESFP	there is no such thing as failure . there are only results .
ISTP	if you are not failing every now and again , it s a sign you are not doing anything very innovative .
ESFP	i think you can have 10,000 explanations for failure , but no good explanation for success .
ISFJ	we failed , but in the good providence of god apparent failure often proves a blessing .
ESFP	do not be embarrassed by your failures , learn from them and start again .
ENTP	failure is always an option .
ESTP	socialism is a philosophy of failure , the creed of ignorance , and the gospel of envy , its inherent virtue is the equal sharing of misery .
ESTP	success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm .
ESTP	develop success from failures . discouragement and failure are two of the surest stepping stones to success .
ESTJ	failure is simply the opportunity to begin again , this time more intelligently .
ESFJ	leadership is solving problems . the day soldiers stop bringing you their problems is the day you have stopped leading them . they have either lost confidence that you can help or concluded you do not care . either case is a failure of leadership .
ENTP	the fact that we are here today to debate raising america s debt limit is a sign of leadership failure . america has a debt problem and a failure of leadership . americans deserve better . i , therefore , intend to oppose the effort to increase america s debt .
ENFJ	think like a queen . a queen is not afraid to fail . failure is another steppingstone to greatness .
ENTP	in america , there s a failure to appreciate europe s leading role in the world .
ENTP	the bush administration s failure to be consistently involved in helping israel achieve peace with the palestinians has been both wrong for our friendship with israel , as well as badly damaging to our standing in the arab world .
ESTP	why should anybody be interested in some old man who was a failure ?
ENTP	so while i will never minimize the costs involved in military action , i am convinced that a failure to act in libya would have carried a far greater price for america .
ESTP	the guns and the bombs , the rockets and the warships , are all symbols of human failure .
ESTP	in all our deeds , the proper value and respect for time determines success or failure .
INTJ	failure is not an option . everyone has to succeed .
INTJ	all human actions are equivalent and all are on principle doomed to failure .
ESTP	i am hopeful . i know there is a lot of ambition in washington , obviously . but i hope the ambitious realize that they are more likely to succeed with success as opposed to failure .
ISFJ	it s not necessary to fear the prospect of failure but to be determined not to fail .
ESFP	whether in success or in failure , i am proud of every single movie i have ever directed .
ESTJ	i do not want the fear of failure to stop me from doing what i really care about .
ESTJ	i have probably earned the right to screw up a few times . i do not want the fear of failure to stop me from doing what i really care about .
INFP	who i am as a guitarist is defined by my failure to become jimi hendrix .
ESFP	there s no right or wrong , success or failure .
ENFP	we need to accept that we wo not always make the right decisions , that we will screw up royally sometimes - understanding that failure is not the opposite of success , it s part of success .
ESTP	without failure there is no sweetness in success . there s no understanding of it .
ISTP	i mean , i love l.a. - i love living here . but i wish that we could make things without the need to hit a home run every single time . it s a unique thing to hollywood that if you do not do that every time , then you are considered a failure . but it s like , well , are you making movies to be successful ? or are you making movies to learn something ? 
ISTP	i mean , i love l.a. - i love living here . but i wish that we could make things without the need to hit a home run every single time . it s a unique thing to hollywood that if you do not do that every time , then you are considered a failure .
ENTJ	the only failure is not to try .
INFJ	i do not understand a way to work other than bold-facedly running towards failure .
ENTJ	if we do not succeed , we run the risk of failure .
ISFP	i realized that i was afraid to really , really try something , 100 % , because i had never reached true failure .
ENTJ	what is more comforting to the terrorists around the world : the failure to pass the 9/11 legislation because we lacked a majority of the majority ,  or putting aside partisan politics to enact tough new legislation with america s security foremost in mind ?
ENFJ	even as far back as when i started acting at 14 , i know i have never considered failure .
ESTJ	if you are not a born-again christian , you are a failure as a human being .
ISTP	unwillingness to risk failure is always there , but it gets harder when you feel you have more to lose .
ESTP	failure ? scared to death of it .
ENFP	i do not want to feel like a failure to my daughter . she s the best thing i have ever done . buffy - pretty great and all , but charlotte s way better .
ISTP	i hate how box-office failures are blamed on an actress , yet i do not see a box-office failure blamed on men .
ENTP	the only reason my work seems to be eclectic up to a certain period is because i was a failure as an actor .
ISFJ	be faithful in small things because it is in them that your strength lies .
ENFJ	faith is taking the first step even when you do not see the whole staircase .
ENFJ	take the first step in faith . you do not have to see the whole staircase , just take the first step .
INTJ	all who call on god in true faith , earnestly from the heart , will certainly be heard , and will receive what they have asked and desired .
INTP	that deep emotional conviction of the presence of a superior reasoning power , which is revealed in the incomprehensible universe , forms my idea of god .
INTP	god always takes the simplest way .
INFJ	if patience is worth anything , it must endure to the end of time . and a living faith will last in the midst of the blackest storm .
INTJ	a casual stroll through the lunatic asylum shows that faith does not prove anything .
ENTP	faith consists in believing when it is beyond the power of reason to believe .
INTJ	faith : not wanting to know what is true .
ESFP	we are never defeated unless we give up on god .
INFJ	faith is not something to grasp , it is a state to grow into .
INFP	now , god be praised , that to believing souls gives light in darkness , comfort in despair .
ENTP	in the affairs of this world , men are saved not by faith , but by the want of it .
INTJ	pray , and let god worry .
INTJ	faith is a living , daring confidence in god s grace , so sure and certain that a man could stake his life on it a thousand times .
INTJ	be a sinner and sin strongly , but more strongly have faith and rejoice in christ .
ESTP	physical strength can never permanently withstand the impact of spiritual force .
INTJ	god ... a being whose only definition is that he is beyond man s power to conceive .

ISTP	always be yourself , express yourself , have faith in yourself , do not go out and look for a successful personality and duplicate it .
INFJ	you must not lose faith in humanity . humanity is an ocean if a few drops of the ocean are dirty , the ocean does not become dirty .

INTP	lets have faith that right makes might and in that faith let us , to the end , dare to do our duty as we understand it .

ESFP	let us be sure that those who come after will say of us in our time , that in our time we did everything that could be done . we finished the race we kept them free we kept the faith .
INFP	i have no faith in human perfectability . i think that human exertion will have no appreciable effect upon humanity . man is now only more active - not more happy - nor more wise , than he was 6000 years ago .
INFJ	faith ... must be enforced by reason ... when faith becomes blind it dies .
ENTP	my family , frankly , they were not folks who went to church every week . my mother was one of the most spiritual people i knew but she did not raise me in the church , so i came to my christian faith later in life and it was because the precepts of jesus christ spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that i would want to lead .
INFP	faith , there hath been many great men that have flattered the people who ne'er loved them .
INFJ	but for my faith in god , i should have been a raving maniac .
INFJ	nonviolence is the first article of my faith . it is also the last article of my creed .
INFJ	intolerance betrays want of faith in one s cause .

INFJ	non-violence requires a double faith , faith in god and also faith in man .

INFP	i have great faith in fools self-confidence my friends call it .
ISTJ	observe good faith and justice toward all nations . cultivate peace and harmony with all .
ISTP	sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick . do not lose faith .
ISTP	technology is nothing . what s important is that you have a faith in people , that they are basically good and smart , and if you give them tools , they will do wonderful things with them .
INTP	faith is the great cop-out , the great excuse to evade the need to think and evaluate evidence . faith is belief in spite of , even perhaps because of , the lack of evidence .
ENFP	to have faith is to trust yourself to the water . when you swim you do not grab hold of the water , because if you do you will sink and drown . instead you relax , and float .
INTJ	anyone who is to find christ must first find the church . how could anyone know where christ is and what faith is in him unless he knew where his believers are ?
ISFJ	christianity is not the faith of the complacent , the comfortable or of the timid . it demands and creates heroic souls like wesley , wilberforce , bonhoeffer , john paul the second , and billy graham . each showed , in their own way , the relentless and powerful influence of the message of jesus christ .
ISTP	it s not the tools that you have faith in - tools are just tools . they work , or they do not work . it s people you have faith in or not . yeah , sure , i am still optimistic i mean , i get pessimistic sometimes but not for long .
INTJ	faith must trample under foot all reason , sense , and understanding .
ISTP	it s not a faith in technology . it s faith in people .
INFP	to insure the adoration of a theorem for any length of time , faith is not enough , a police force is needed as well .
ENTP	my parents shared not only an improbable love , they shared an abiding faith in the possibilities of this nation . they would give me an african name , barack , or blessed , believing that in a tolerant america your name is no barrier to success .
ENTP	you know , my faith is one that admits some doubt .
ENTP	what i think is fair to say is that , coming out of the republican camp , there have been efforts to suggest that perhaps i am not who i say i am when it comes to my faith - something which i find deeply offensive , and that has been going on for a pretty long time .
INTJ	if he have faith , the believer can not be restrained . he betrays himself . he breaks out . he confesses and teaches this gospel to the people at the risk of life itself .
INTJ	faith is permitting ourselves to be seized by the things we do not see .
INTJ	reason is the enemy of faith .
ISFJ	it strikes me as odd that the free exercise of religious faith is sometimes treated as a problem , something america is stuck with instead of blessed with .
ENFJ	only the person who has faith in himself is able to be faithful to others .
INTP	the meme for blind faith secures its own perpetuation by the simple unconscious expedient of discouraging rational inquiry .
ISFJ	no person i have ever met , not even the most righteous or pure of heart , has gone without those times when faith recedes in the busy-ness of life .
ISFJ	this president takes his inspiration from the capitals of europe we look to the cities and small towns of america . this president puts his faith in government . we put our faith in the american people .
ISFJ	men and women of every faith and good people with none at all sincerely strive to do right and lead a purpose-driven life .
ISTJ	there is nothing wrong with america that faith , love of freedom , intelligence , and energy of her citizens can not cure .
INTP	if children understand that beliefs should be substantiated with evidence , as opposed to tradition , authority , revelation or faith , they will automatically work out for themselves that they are atheists .
ENFP	in other words , a person who is fanatic in matters of religion , and clings to certain ideas about the nature of god and the universe , becomes a person who has no faith at all .
ESTP	no lover , if he be of good faith , and sincere , will deny he would prefer to see his mistress dead than unfaithful .

ISTJ	only our individual faith in freedom can keep us free .
ESTP	a better world shall emerge based on faith and understanding .
ENFP	faith is a state of openness or trust .
ESTP	do i think faith will be an important part of being a good president ? yes , i do .
ENFP	faith is part of who i am , yes . i was raised christian scientist . the most important thing i saw every single week on the wall at sunday school was the golden rule .
INTP	faith is not believing that god can . it is knowing that god will .
INTP	at least the fundamentalists have not tried to dilute their message . their faith is exposed for what it is for all to see .
ESTP	faith crosses every border and touches every heart in every nation .
ESFP	i never really had the classic struggle . i had faith .
ENTJ	if i advocate cautious optimism it is not because i do not have faith in the future but because i do not want to encourage blind faith .
INTJ	religion is part of the human make-up . it s also part of our cultural and intellectual history . religion was our first attempt at literature , the texts , our first attempt at cosmology , making sense of where we are in the universe , our first attempt at health care , believing in faith healing , our first attempt at philosophy .
ESTP	our society is illuminated by the spiritual insights of the hebrew prophets . america and israel have a common love of human freedom , and they have a common faith in a democratic way of life .
ESTP	the separation of church and state is a source of strength , but the conscience of our nation does not call for separation between men of state and faith in the supreme being .
ESFP	it s very important that every movie i do makes money because i want the people that had the faith in me to get their money back .
INFJ	let judges secretly despair of justice : their verdicts will be more acute . let generals secretly despair of triumph killing will be defamed . let priests secretly despair of faith : their compassion will be true .
ISFJ	i do not think that the total creation took place in six days as we now measure time . if we can confirm , say , the big bang theory , that does not at all cause me to question my faith that god created the big bang .
INTJ	trust is not the same as faith . a friend is someone you trust . putting faith in anyone is a mistake .
INTJ	there s been some research in cognitive science , i am told , that discloses that there have always been perhaps 10 to 15 percent of people who are , as pascal puts it , so made that they can not believe . to us , when people talk about faith , it s white noise .
INFP	base souls have no faith in great individuals .
ESTP	between understanding and faith immediate connections must subsist .
ISFJ	i think there ought to be a strict separation or wall built between our religious faith and our practice of political authority in office . i do not think the president of the united states should extoll christianity if he happens to be a christian at the expense of judaism , islam or other faiths .
ESFP	my faith helps me understand that circumstances do not dictate my happiness , my inner peace .
ESTP	faith hill is a big role model .
ISFJ	you just have to have a simple faith .
ISFJ	in religious and in secular affairs , the more fervent beliefs attract followers . if you are a moderate in any respect - if you are a moderate on abortion , if you are a moderate on gun control , or if you are a moderate in your religious faith - it does not evolve into a crusade where you are either right or wrong , good or bad , with us or against us .
INFP	i do not know if the average person really has faith in washington anymore .
ENFP	i have always thought that as long as directors and casting directors do not see me as just harry potter , i will be ok. people have shown a lot of faith in me , and i owe them a huge debt . they are letting me prove that i am serious about this .
ESFP	i have always been the kid who s asked why ?  in my faith , you are just supposed to have faith . but i was always like why ? 
ISTJ	the christian faith can never be separated from the soil of sacred events , from the choice made by god , who wanted to speak to us , to become man , to die and rise again , in a particular place and at a particular time .
ESTP	let me go over this again on the reclaiming the civil rights movement . people of faith that believe that you have an equal right to justice - that is the essence . and if it s not the essence , then we have been sold a pack of lies . the essence is everyone deserves a shot - the content of character , not the color of skin .
ESFP	but i do not necessarily define my faith by going to church every sunday .
ISFP	i just sort of take it from a character perspective , and i do not know if he was necessarily spiritual , but i do think he had hope . he was a character that was comfortable having hope in his life , and hope is faith .
ESFJ	my gut feeling about sequels is that they should be premeditated : you should try to write a trilogy first or at least sketch out a trilogy if you have any faith in your film .
ENFJ	my faith foundation works to bring about a greater respect and understanding between different faiths . we basically work with six popular religions in the world which are the three abrahamic religions , hinduism and buddhism and sikhism .
ISTJ	laughter kills fear , and without fear there can be no faith . for without fear of the devil there is no need for god .
ESTP	all an actor has is their blind faith that they are who they say they are today , in any scene .

INFJ	i have this embedded faith in the process through which films of a certain type get discovered on longer timelines .
ISTJ	the abuse of faith has to be resisted precisely .
ESFJ	earmarks have become a symbol of a congress that has broken faith with the people . this earmark ban shows the american people we are listening and we are dead serious about ending business as usual in washington .
ESTJ	president obama and his radical feminist enforcers have had it in for catholic medical providers from the get-go . it s about time all people of faith fought back against this unprecedented encroachment on religious liberty . first , they came for the catholics . who s next ?
ESTJ	i think the moslem faith teaches hate .
ESTJ	i have faith in the jury system .
ISFP	family is the most important thing in the world .
ESFJ	you do not choose your family . they are god s gift to you , as you are to them .
ISFJ	america can not continue to lead the family of nations around the world if we suffer the collapse of the family here at home .
ESTP	first and foremost comes my family and my life with brad . we have so much joy in raising our children and teaching them about the world that nothing really compares to that .
ESTJ	when you have a godly husband , a godly wife , children who respect their parents and who are loved by their parents , who provide for those children their physical and spiritual and material needs , lovingly , you have the ideal unit .
ISFP	what must it be like for a little boy to read that daddy never loved mummy ?
ESFJ	my kids give me the balance to live right .
ENFP	there is no such thing as fun for the whole family .
INTP	i have frequently been questioned , especially by women , of how i could reconcile family life with a scientific career . well , it has not been easy .
ISFP	a family is a risky venture , because the greater the love , the greater the loss ... that s the trade-off . but i will take it all .
ESFP	a woman should be home with the children , building that home and making sure there s a secure family atmosphere .
ENFP	at a certain point i am going to want to have a family .
ESFJ	we will sort of get over the marriage first and then maybe look at the kids . but obviously we want a family so we will have to start thinking about that .
ENTJ	i love children and i get along with them great . it s just that i believe if you are going to be a parent , there has to be something inside you that says , i want a family .  i do not feel that sense of urgency .
ESFJ	i do not know if i believe in marriage . i believe in family , love and children .
ENTP	it was the labor movement that helped secure so much of what we take for granted today . the 40-hour work week , the minimum wage , family leave , health insurance , social security , medicare , retirement plans . the cornerstones of the middle-class security all bear the union label .
ENFP	fathers should be neither seen nor heard . that is the only proper basis for family life .
ENTP	he that raises a large family does , indeed , while he lives to observe them , stand a broader mark for sorrow but then he stands a broader mark for pleasure too .
ENFP	the other night i ate at a real nice family restaurant . every table had an argument going .
ENTP	i can make a firm pledge , under my plan , no family making less than $ 250,000 a year will see any form of tax increase . not your income tax , not your payroll tax , not your capital gains taxes , not any of your taxes .
ISFP	the details surrounding both my marriage and subsequent filing for divorce are private , and i had hoped to keep them that way for the sake of my family .
ISFJ	all the laws and legislation in the world will never heal this world like the loving hearts and arms of mothers and fathers . if every child could drift to sleep feeling wrapped in the love of their family - and god s love - this world would be a far more gentle and better place .
ENTP	but let me perfectly clear , because i know you will hear the same old claims that rolling back these tax breaks means a massive tax increase on the american people : if your family earns less than $ 250,000 a year , you will not see your taxes increased a single dime . i repeat : not one single dime .
ENFJ	i am confident that nobody ... will accuse me of selfishness if i ask to spend time , while i am still in good health , with my family , my friends and also with myself .
ISFJ	in the richest country in the history of the world , this obama economy has crushed the middle class . family income has fallen by $ 4,000 , but health insurance premiums are higher , food prices are higher , utility bills are higher , and gasoline prices have doubled . today more americans wake up in poverty than ever before .
ENFP	we believed in our idea - a family park where parents and children could have fun- together .
ENTP	i have muslim members of my family . i have lived in muslim countries .
INFP	i was angry and frustrated until i started my own family and my first child was born . until then i did not really appreciate life the way i should have , but fortunately i woke up .
ESTJ	my mother s love has always been a sustaining force for our family , and one of my greatest joys is seeing her integrity , her compassion , her intelligence reflected in my daughters .
ISFJ	now is the moment when we can stand up and say , i am an american . i make my destiny . and we deserve better ! my children deserve better ! my family deserves better . my country deserves better !  so here we stand . americans have a choice .
ISFJ	the promise of america has always been that if you worked hard , had the right values , took some risks , that there was an opportunity to build a better life for your family and for your next generation .
ISFJ	president obama promised to begin to slow the rise of the oceans and heal the planet . my promise ... is to help you and your family .
ESTJ	you can not have maternal health without reproductive health . and reproductive health includes contraception and family planning and access to legal , safe abortion .
INFP	a family with the wrong members in control that , perhaps , is as near as one can come to describing england in a phrase .
ENFP	where would you be without friends ? the people to pick you up when you need lifting ? we come from homes far from perfect , so you end up almost parent and sibling to your friends - your own chosen family . there s nothing like a really loyal , dependable , good friend . nothing .
ESTJ	in my family , we were americans , we were republicans and we were methodists .
INTJ	i believe with all my heart that america remains the great idea  that inspires the world . it is a privilege to be born here . it is an honor to become a citizen here . it is a gift to raise your family here , to vote here , and to live here .
INTJ	my work and my family are very important to me .
INTJ	everything i have , my career , my success , my family , i owe to america .
ISFP	it s hard knowing who to trust with your personal life . when you cry in your room at night , you do not always know who to call . so i am very close to my family .
INTJ	think about what people are doing on facebook today . they are keeping up with their friends and family , but they are also building an image and identity for themselves , which in a sense is their brand . they are connecting with the audience that they want to connect to . it s almost a disadvantage if you are not on it now .
INTJ	i had this child , and it destroyed my family .
ESFJ	the god who existed before any religion counts on you to make the oneness of the human family known and celebrated .
ISFJ	the virtue of privacy is one that must be protected in matters that are intimate and within one s own family .
ESFJ	god s dream is that you and i and all of us will realize that we are family , that we are made for togetherness , for goodness , and for compassion .
ENFJ	in the investigation of a neurotic style of life , we must always suspect an opponent , and note who suffers most because of the patient s condition . usually this is a member of the family .
ESFP	i can not remember a moment in my life when i have not felt the love of my family . we were a family that would have killed for each other - and we still are .
ESFJ	in god s family , there are no outsiders , no enemies .

ESFP	it all starts with the script : it s not worth taking myself away from my family if i do not have something i am really passionate about .
ISFP	there s a schizoid streak within the family anyway so i dare say that i am affected by that . the majority of the people in my family have been in some kind of mental institution , as for my brother he does not want to leave . he likes it very much .

ESTJ	together , we can help make sure that every family that walks into a restaurant can make an easy , healthy choice .
INTJ	and when i was young , my family was perfectly nice . i write a lot about it , as you noticed . but it was rather limited . i think , i do not think anyone in my family would really feel i d done them an injustice by saying that . we did not see many people . there were many books . it was as if i wanted to get away from home .

ISFP	i really have created a family . i work with the people i love , i travel with them , i make films with them , and i am in an office with them . so in a weird way - i know i have not birthed a child - i feel that i am a part of creating a family . it s a tribe . i love that word .
ISFP	when i did e.t. ,  it sort of solidified the only family i know are these film crews . these gypsies . these filmmakers . that was the solidification and the clicking revelations of this is what i want to do with my life and this is where i am going to survive .

ESTP	it is better for you to be free of fear lying upon a pallet , than to have a golden couch and a rich table and be full of trouble .

ENTJ	we should all grow our own food and do our own waste processing , we really should .

ENTP	i have always liked atlanta . and not just for the strip clubs , but the shopping and the food .

INFP	so , what s it like in the real world ? well , the food is better , but beyond that , i do not recommend it .

ESFJ	i try to eat in a way that makes me feel good . if that means a little bite of chocolate i do that , but i try not to use food as a reward for myself .
ESFP	just because the americans are so good at rattling out accessible and cheap junk food , nobody looks twice when it comes to their food . but there are golden nuggets everywhere .
ENFJ	in england and america people tend to graze all day long , but i think it s such a waste to be constantly picking at food because you then ca not enjoy a proper full meal when the time comes .

ESFP	it s very clear that there s a lot of double standards going on . should there be a 30mph speed limit ? of course there bloody should . and certainly with kids and school food , kids need to be nannied for sure . so give them a bloody good meal at school .
ESFP	give your kids a bloody knife and fork and let me put some fresh food in front of them they can eat .

ESFP	i want americans to enjoy food . i want them to celebrate food . i want them to , on occasions , to have big cakes and great things . and i want them to indulge .
ESFP	i would not say that processed food , ready meals and even takeaways are not relevant to modern life , it s just that over the past 40 years there are three generations of people who have come out of school and gone through their home life without ever being shown how to cook properly .
ENTP	i get way too much happiness from good food .
ESTJ	they advertise on the radio for food stamps !

ENFJ	darkness can not drive out darkness only light can do that . hate can not drive out hate only love can do that .

ENFP	if only i was not an atheist , i could get away with anything . you d just ask for forgiveness and then you d be forgiven . it sounds much better than having to live with guilt .
ESFJ	because forgiveness is like this : a room can be dank because you have closed the windows , you have closed the curtains . but the sun is shining outside , and the air is fresh outside . in order to get that fresh air , you have to get up and open the window and draw the curtains apart .
ESFJ	before nelson mandela was arrested in 1962 , he was an angry , relatively young man . he founded the anc s military wing . when he was released , he surprised everyone because he was talking about reconciliation and forgiveness and not about revenge .
ESTP	i find forgiveness to be really healthy .
ESTJ	on the day of atonement , jews are commanded to seek forgiveness from the people we have hurt .

INFJ	freedom is absolutely necessary for the progress in science and the liberal arts .
ESTP	we are giving our freedoms away . the american experiment was about freedom . freedom to be stupid , freedom to fail , freedom to succeed .

ESFP	the cost of freedom is always high , but americans have always paid it . and one path we shall never choose , and that is the path of surrender , or submission .

ESTP	true individual freedom can not exist without economic security and independence . people who are hungry and out of a job are the stuff of which dictatorships are made .
INFP	punk is musical freedom . it s saying , doing and playing what you want . in webster s terms , nirvana  means freedom from pain , suffering and the external world , and that s pretty close to my definition of punk rock .
ESFP	in the long history of the world , only a few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger . i do not shrink from this responsibility - i welcome it .
INFJ	freedom is never dear at any price . it is the breath of life . what would a man not pay for living ?
ISTJ	most people do not really want freedom , because freedom involves responsibility , and most people are frightened of responsibility .
ISFP	i am involved in a freedom ride protesting the loss of the minority rights belonging to the few remaining earthbound stars . all we demanded was our right to twinkle .
INFJ	violent means will give violent freedom . that would be a menace to the world and to india herself .
ESFP	the path we have chosen for the present is full of hazards , as all paths are . the cost of freedom is always high , but americans have always paid it . and one path we shall never choose , and that is the path of surrender , or submission .
INFP	i am interested in anything about revolt , disorder , chaos-especially activity that seems to have no meaning . it seems to me to be the road toward freedom ... rather than starting inside , i start outside and reach the mental through the physical .

INFP	i am interested in anything about revolt , disorder , chaos , especially activity that appears to have no meaning . it seems to me to be the road toward freedom .
ESFP	we can not expect that all nations will adopt like systems , for conformity is the jailer of freedom and the enemy of growth .

ESTJ	the framers of our constitution meant we were to have freedom of religion , not freedom from religion .
ENFJ	communists have always played an active role in the fight by colonial countries for their freedom , because the short-term objects of communism would always correspond with the long-term objects of freedom movements .
ENFJ	where globalization means , as it so often does , that the rich and powerful now have new means to further enrich and empower themselves at the cost of the poorer and weaker , we have a responsibility to protest in the name of universal freedom .
ISFP	i think of a hero as someone who understands the degree of responsibility that comes with his freedom .
ISFJ	religious liberty is the first freedom in our constitution . and whether the cause is justice for the persecuted , compassion for the needy and the sick , or mercy for the child waiting to be born , there is no greater force for good in the nation than christian conscience in action .
ESTP	i believe in a religion that believes in freedom . any time i have to accept a religion that wo not let me fight a battle for my people , i say to hell with that religion .
INFP	without culture , and the relative freedom it implies , society , even when perfect , is but a jungle . this is why any authentic creation is a gift to the future .

ENFJ	only free men can negotiate prisoners can not enter into contracts . your freedom and mine can not be separated .
ENFJ	there is no such thing as part freedom .
ENTP	we , the people , recognize that we have responsibilities as well as rights that our destinies are bound together that a freedom which only asks what s in it for me , a freedom without a commitment to others , a freedom without love or charity or duty or patriotism , is unworthy of our founding ideals , and those who died in their defense .
ESTP	freedom from effort in the present merely means that there has been effort stored up in the past .
ENFJ	our single most important challenge is therefore to help establish a social order in which the freedom of the individual will truly mean the freedom of the individual .

ESFP	cheryl cole and katy perry are two of the hottest girls in the world - and so normal and funny with it . if i was a few years older they are the kind of girls i d like to date . i want a younger version of cheryl and katy - a mixture of the two would be hot .
ENTP	i never smoked . i never drank and i never took drugs . the funny thing is , nothing is more boring , people like this . for me , it s ok . but most of my friends , at least they smoke and drink .
ISFP	one time i went into a restroom and a girl followed me in . i signed an autograph for her in the sink . it was pretty funny because she was in a guy s restroom and she was not embarrassed at all .
ISFP	the people i grew up around who i really liked were quick on the draw . it always just wowed me . and my mum would make weird funny comments . i can see in myself her self-deprecating , hippie humour . i ca not take myself too seriously .
ENFP	i mean i have seen 3d films so far and i think it s a long way to go before they replace actors . it s a funny thing with 3d , i have not quite got it yet . yet .
ESTP	i like funny guys and those , for some reason , tend to be nerdy guys .
ESFP	i was a hop-around . i hung out with the rockabilly crew , the guys who were trying to be rappers , the funny kids .
ESFP	i wanted to be that quirky girl who writes funny songs that still have meaning .
ENTP	it s only i have seen enough of it and the funny thing is now , i know that i am skinny , because i know there are even smaller clothes in the store . i think i am big , when i was big , i never thought about it .
ISFP	i find it so funny that people find me so interesting .
ISTP	i had to act in a school play when i was about ten years old . i really did not want to do it . but everyone had to do it so i did not have a choice . a talent agent came and watched it and later gave me some work . it s funny because i d always known that i wanted a movie career . i just did not think that i would be in the movies .
ISTP	i am like , bursting . i should be working . i do not want to take a break . it s funny , on set , i do not have to go to the bathroom , i do not have anything wrong , i am perfectly fine , so through-and-through . i am not hungry . i am literally not even in my own body .
ISTP	it s a funny thing : you want so badly for people to see what you do - you are proud of it - and i like the effect that movies have on people . but the attention can also make me uncomfortable .
ISTP	and i like to keep whatever is mine remaining that way . it s a funny little game to play and it s a slippery slope . i always say to myself i am never going to give anything away because there s never any point or benefit for me .
ISFJ	there s something dangerous about what s funny . jarring and disconcerting . there is a connection between funny and scary .
ISFJ	some people can do things and get away with it . comics are famously like that . why is it that some guys can say the most horrible things and it s not offensive , it s funny ?
ISFJ	i always like to watch comics and it s interesting that you can tell if someone s funny in 10 seconds .
ESFP	the funny thing is people wo not let me pay for things . i will be in a restaurant and the manager will say , oh no , it s on the house . 
ISTP	i find it very easy playing bond . i think he s hilarious . he gets himself into some extraordinarily funny situations .
ISFJ	laurence olivier said in an interview once that when he plays a tragedy he always aims for the funny parts , and the other way around . because in a comedy you look for what s serious . i think that s true . sometimes things are really funny if you are absolutely earnest . if you are really serious , it s hilarious .
ISFJ	i never know when i am being funny , and the other way too . i do not think you can think about that . i do not think you can try to be funny . some people are just funny .
INFP	i am just not one of those naturally funny , relaxed actors who enjoy the spotlight and are so good at it .
INFP	it was always a fantasy of mine growing up - my favorite program was always little house on the prairie  - so i always wanted to wear those looks . when i was a child , i would not let my mom put me in anything but calico dresses and now ... whaddaya know , every day i am in a calico dress , basically , so it s kind of funny .
ESTJ	it s funny that there was so much disturbance about having a catholic in the white house with kennedy , and when we finally get a religion in the white house that s causing a lot of conflicts , and concerns , and disturbances for a lot of people , it s in the bush administration .
INFP	you know , i have always thought that it would be really funny if somebody made a romantic comedy where absolutely everything went well from beginning to end .
ESFJ	this is going to sound really funny . i have a poster of zac efron on my wall ! i think every girl has a poster of him in their room so , why not join the club !
ENTP	i think i have an inner confidence that my tastes are pretty simple , that what i find funny finds a wide audience . i am not particularly intellectual or clever or minority-focused in my creative instincts . and i am certainly not aware of suppressing more sophisticated ambitions .
ENTP	funny things tend not to happen to me . i am not a natural comic . i need to think about things a lot before i can be even remotely amusing .
INFP	it s funny how the hippies and the punks tried to get rid of the conservatives , but they always seem to get the upper hand in the end .
INFP	i recently spent quite a bit of time in sheffield , england , which is where i am from . i would not move back there , but it s funny when you spend a bit of time in the place where you were brought up . you kind of realize how that place has had quite a big effect on you or made you a certain way .
ESTJ	it s funny , because i never think of myself as little miss all-together .
ESTJ	when i was a kid i did not feel like i fit in because - this is really silly and i probably should not say it , but , i did not think anything was funny . so i used to go home and literally cry to my mom and my step-dad at the time and i did not think anything was funny . i could not laugh .
INFP	music is more difficult - try naming a political band . the dead kennedys . the dead kennedys are political , but they are more funny than they are political .
ENFJ	comedians do not laugh . they are too busy analyzing why it s funny or not .
ENFJ	also , in a funny way , if you have been happily married there are no unresolved areas , nothing to prove to yourself after the other dies .
ENFJ	i think saturday night live  , starting in the 1970s , really gave women an outlet to be funny . a lot of those women went on to have film careers , from kristen wiig now to tina fey and gilda radner .
ENTP	it s so funny , because right now i am very tired and my brains a little dead , i tend to get very focused and serious . so , i am probably coming off a lot more like scully right now .
ISTP	it s a required part of your film history to know who woody is . his movies are so wonderful , and not just funny but so insightful about human behavior .
ESTP	i have dated some women who have turned me on to some funny things that are strange for men to actually do , but these things have become part of my process . i think the things i do for my appearance help make me look better . i even colour my hair because i like how it makes me look .
INFJ	i do find comedy difficult . i do not know why . maybe i think about it too much . there s a tremendous amount of pressure to be funny .
ENFJ	it s funny that it all becomes about clothes . it s bizarre . you work your butt off and then you win an award and it s all about your dress . you ca not get away from it .
ESTJ	i was not particularly bright , i was not very athletic , i was a little too tall , odd , funny looking , i was just really weird as a kid .
ENFP	so often , i read scripts and am like , this would never happen in real life . it s not trying to be funny . it s trying to be serious . 
ISTJ	it s funny , growing up there was never anybody around me with any kind of artistic bent .
ENTP	sometimes in the most tragic situation , something just profoundly funny happens .
ESFJ	if you can find the line between sympathetic and creepy , you have reached a very funny area .
ENFJ	my parents are both very funny but they are also relatively soft-spoken , normal human beings while i am just a lunatic . i do not know where this loud , ballsy , hammy ridiculousness came from . i am just glad i followed my goals and my parents did too . it s not like we even had a plan when i dragged my mom to los angeles .
ESTP	the empires of the future are the empires of the mind .
ENFP	every saint has a past and every sinner has a future .
ISTP	again , you ca not connect the dots looking forward you can only connect them looking backwards . so you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future . you have to trust in something - your gut , destiny , life , karma , whatever . this approach has never let me down , and it has made all the difference in my life .
INTP	i never think of the future - it comes soon enough .
INFP	it is not in the stars to hold our destiny but in ourselves .
INTP	the distinction between the past , present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion .
ISTP	you ca not connect the dots looking forward you can only connect them looking backwards . so you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future . you have to trust in something - your gut , destiny , life , karma , whatever . this approach has never let me down , and it has made all the difference in my life .
ESTP	if we open a quarrel between past and present , we shall find that we have lost the future .
INFJ	i do not want to foresee the future . i am concerned with taking care of the present . god has given me no control over the moment following .
ESFP	stop acting as if life is a rehearsal . live this day as if it were your last . the past is over and gone . the future is not guaranteed .
INFP	who controls the past controls the future . who controls the present controls the past .
ENFP	there s no present . there s only the immediate future and the recent past .
ISFJ	never let the future disturb you . you will meet it , if you have to , with the same weapons of reason which today arm you against the present .
ENFJ	our human compassion binds us the one to the other - not in pity or patronizingly , but as human beings who have learnt how to turn our common suffering into hope for the future .
ENTP	the future rewards those who press on . i do not have time to feel sorry for myself . i do not have time to complain . i am going to press on .
INTJ	upper classes are a nation s past the middle class is its future .
ISFP	well , the future for me is already a thing of the past .
ESTP	the future belongs to those who prepare for it today .
INFJ	prediction is very difficult , especially if it s about the future .
ISFJ	look back over the past , with its changing empires that rose and fell , and you can foresee the future , too .
INTJ	let the future tell the truth , and evaluate each one according to his work and accomplishments . the present is theirs the future , for which i have really worked , is mine .
ESTP	if future generations are to remember us more with gratitude than sorrow , we must achieve more than just the miracles of technology . we must also leave them a glimpse of the world as it was created , not just as it looked when we got through with it .
ISFP	hold fast to the bible . to the influence of this book we are indebted for all the progress made in true civilization and to this we must look as our guide in the future .
ESTJ	i have not been faithful to my own advice in the past . i will in the future .
ENTJ	control your own destiny or someone else will .
ESFP	let us not seek the republican answer or the democratic answer , but the right answer . let us not seek to fix the blame for the past . let us accept our own responsibility for the future .
INTP	the assertion that all men are created equal  was of no practical use in effecting our separation from great britain and it was placed in the declaration not for that , but for future use .
ESFP	our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this planet . we all breathe the same air . we all cherish our children s future . and we are all mortal .
ESFP	i look forward to a great future for america - a future in which our country will match its military strength with our moral restraint , its wealth with our wisdom , its power with our purpose .
ESFP	to state the facts frankly is not to despair the future nor indict the past . the prudent heir takes careful inventory of his legacies and gives a faithful accounting to those whom he owes an obligation of trust .
INFP	if you want a vision of the future , imagine a boot stamping on a human face - forever .
ESFP	history is a relentless master . it has no present , only the past rushing into the future . to try to hold fast is to be swept aside .
ESFP	while i take inspiration from the past , like most americans , i live for the future .
INTJ	all sciences are now under the obligation to prepare the ground for the future task of the philosopher , which is to solve the problem of value , to determine the true hierarchy of values .
INFP	all political thinking for years past has been vitiated in the same way . people can foresee the future only when it coincides with their own wishes , and the most grossly obvious facts can be ignored when they are unwelcome .
ESTP	do not forget what i discovered that over ninety percent of all national deficits from 1921 to 1939 were caused by payments for past , present , and future wars .
INTJ	the future influences the present just as much as the past .
ISTP	everyone here has the sense that right now is one of those moments when we are influencing the future .
ENTP	you can never plan the future by the past .
ISTP	we have demonstrated a strong track record of being very disciplined with the use of our cash . we do not let it burn a hole in our pocket , we do not allow it to motivate us to do stupid acquisitions . and so i think that we d like to continue to keep our powder dry , because we do feel that there are one or more strategic opportunities in the future .
INFP	real generosity toward the future lies in giving all to the present .
ESFP	go for it now . the future is promised to no one .
ISTP	deficits mean future tax increases , pure and simple . deficit spending should be viewed as a tax on future generations , and politicians who create deficits should be exposed as tax hikers .
INFP	it is by no means an irrational fancy that , in a future existence , we shall look upon what we think our present existence , as a dream .
ESFP	we are the only beings on the planet who lead such rich internal lives that it s not the events that matter most to us , but rather , it s how we interpret those events that will determine how we think about ourselves and how we will act in the future .
ESTJ	god is more interested in your future and your relationships than you are .
ENFJ	the danger of the past was that men became slaves . the danger of the future is that man may become robots .
ENFJ	when i look into the future , it s so bright it burns my eyes .
ISFJ	here is the rule to remember in the future , when anything tempts you to be bitter : not , this is a misfortune  but to bear this worthily is good fortune . 
ENTP	as i have said , there were patriots who supported this war , and patriots who opposed it . and all of us are united in appreciation for our servicemen and women , and our hopes for iraqis  future .
ESTP	not only our future economic soundness but the very soundness of our democratic institutions depends on the determination of our government to give employment to idle men .
ENTP	it is said that the present is pregnant with the future .
ENTP	our combat mission is ending , but our commitment to iraq s future is not .
ISTP	i was a peripheral visionary . i could see the future , but only way off to the side .
ESTP	i try to learn from the past , but i plan for the future by focusing exclusively on the present . that s were the fun is .
ISTJ	neither a wise man nor a brave man lies down on the tracks of history to wait for the train of the future to run over him .
ISFJ	instead of just giving lip service to improving our schools , i will actually put the kids first and the teachers union behind in giving our kids better teachers , better options and better choices for a better future .
ISFJ	the american people i talk to do not spend every moment thinking , how can i tax my neighbor more than they are being taxed ?  they say , how can i get a good job ? how can my kids get good jobs ? how can seniors have a confidence in their future when they know that social security , medicare and medicaid are bankrupt ? 
ISFJ	internationally , president obama has adopted an appeasement strategy . he believes america s role as leader in the world is a thing of the past . i believe a strong america must - and will - lead the future .
ESTJ	the worst thing that can happen in a democracy - as well as in an individual s life - is to become cynical about the future and lose hope .
INTP	how paramount the future is to the present when one is surrounded by children .
INTP	at some future period , not very distant as measured by centuries , the civilized races of man will almost certainly exterminate , and replace the savage races throughout the world .
ENFP	i have realized that the past and future are real illusions , that they exist in the present , which is what there is and all there is .
ESTJ	my wish for the new millennium is for all children ... to grow up wiser , and stronger and more prosperous for the future than ever before .
INTJ	humanity has the stars in its future , and that future is too important to be lost under the burden of juvenile folly and ignorant superstition .
INTJ	the country that is more developed industrially only shows , to the less developed , the image of its own future .
ESTJ	we have a close , unshakable bond between the united states and israel , and between the american and israeli people . we share common values and a commitment to a democratic future for the world , and we are both committed to a two-state solution . but that does not mean that we are going to agree .
ISFJ	republicans are men of narrow vision , who are afraid of the future .
ESFP	people always ask me , what is it that you regret ?  and i say , nothing , because i could not buy what i have learned .  and i apply those things to my life i learn . and hopefully , hopefully it helps me to be a better human in the future and make better choices .
INTJ	i welcome and seek your ideas , but do not bring me small ideas bring me big ideas to match our future .
ENFP	no valid plans for the future can be made by those who have no capacity for living now .
INTJ	the future is green energy , sustainability , renewable energy .
INTJ	when the people become involved in their government , government becomes more accountable , and our society is stronger , more compassionate , and better prepared for the challenges of the future .
ESTP	i have not had that one great love , which is good . i do not want that to be in the past - i want it to be in the future .
INTP	evolution never looks to the future .
ENTP	when you get just a complete sense of blackness or void ahead of you , that somehow the future looks an impossible place to be , and the direction you are going seems to have no purpose , there is this word despair which is a very awful thing to feel .
ENTP	i like today and perhaps a little future still , but the past is really something i am not interested in . so , as far as i am concerned , i like only the past of things and people i do not know . when i know , i do not care because i knew how it was .
ENTJ	if we have to use force , it is because we are america . we are the indispensable nation . we stand tall . we see further into the future .
ENTP	we are at the crossroads . down one road is a european centralized bureaucratic socialist welfare system in which politicians and bureaucrats define the future . down the other road is a proud , solid , reaffirmation of american exceptionalism .
INFP	i am not good at future planning . i do not plan at all . i do not know what i am doing tomorrow . i do not have a day planner and i do not have a diary . i completely live in the now , not in the past , not in the future .
INFP	the problem with the future is that it keeps turning into the present .
ESFP	i believe life is a series of near misses . a lot of what we ascribe to luck is not luck at all . it s seizing the day and accepting responsibility for your future . it s seeing what other people do not see and pursuing that vision .
ESFJ	do your duty and a little more and the future will take care of itself .
ISFP	i am a person that carries everything that happened to me in my past , with me into the future . i refuse to let it make me bitter . i still completely believe in love and i remain open to anything that will happen to me .
ISFJ	you never know what the future holds or where my life will take me .
ISTP	i am always thinking about creating . my future starts when i wake up every morning ... every day i find something creative to do with my life .
ESFP	i am still driving along on the pop freeway of life . thinking even further into the future , i definitely want to make an acoustic record . i want to try lots of different things .
ESTJ	if my future were determined just by my performance on a standardized test , i would not be here . i guarantee you that .
ISFP	i am working on bringing the instant film camera back as part of the future .
ENFP	i am not sitting dwelling about the past or stressing or fretting about something in the future .
ISFJ	all i can say is that i am getting married in the future . i have narrowed it down to that .
ISFJ	i am confident that when the facts and policies have been examined , when the record of performances have been reviewed , barack obama and joe biden will once again be elected to lead our beloved country to a better future .
ESFP	we are trying to set up a movie for me in the near future . it s going to be similar to the story of how i got discovered . kinda like my own version of 8 mile . 
ESFP	i am happy , i am in a good place , i am looking forward to my future .
INTJ	the question of armaments , whether on land or sea , is the most immediately and intensely practical question connected with the future fortunes of nations and of mankind .
INTJ	the importance of money flows from it being a link between the present and the future .
ENTP	my theme is going to be : together we can win the future . the right policies lead to the right results . and i am going to argue that president obama will lose the future because the wrong policies lead to the wrong results .
ISFP	my future daughter is not going to go through what i did .
ISFP	when you relinquish the desire to control your future , you can have more happiness .
ENTP	i think my view is that whenever you project into the future you are never likely to be accurate in the details , or the paraphernalia and style . it s in the spirit of it .
ENTP	you have to like the present if not your life becomes secondhand , if you think it was better before . or that it will be better in the future .
ENFJ	our modern states are preparing for war without even knowing the future enemy .
ENTJ	if ge s strategy of investment in china is wrong , it represents a loss of a billion dollars , perhaps a couple of billion dollars . if it is right , it is the future of this company for the next century .
ENFP	up against the corporate government , voters find themselves asked to choose between look-alike candidates from two parties vying to see who takes the marching orders from their campaign paymasters and their future employers . the money of vested interest nullifies genuine voter choice and trust .
INTP	promises are the uniquely human way of ordering the future , making it predictable and reliable to the extent that this is humanly possible .
INTJ	there is a huge need and a huge opportunity to get everyone in the world connected , to give everyone a voice and to help transform society for the future . the scale of the technology and infrastructure that must be built is unprecedented , and we believe this is the most important problem we can focus on .
INTJ	the social object of skilled investment should be to defeat the dark forces of time and ignorance which envelope our future .
ENFJ	the white house is not the place to learn how to deal with international crisis , the balance of power , war and peace , and the economic future of the next generation .
ESFJ	i am pro-life . i will do all i can to see every baby is created with a future and potential . the legislature should do all it can to protect human life .
ENFJ	in retrospect , the millennium marked only a moment in time . it was the events of september 11 that marked a turning point in history , where we confront the dangers of the future and assess the choices facing humankind .
ISTP	the future battle on the ground will be preceded by battle in the air . this will determine which of the contestants has to suffer operational and tactical disadvantages and be forced throughout the battle into adoption compromise solutions .
ENFP	such is the miraculous nature of the future of exiles : what is first uttered in the impotence of an overheated apartment becomes the fate of nations .
ENFJ	i never have plans for the future as you never know how things will turn out .
INFP	i do not have that much forward planning about what i want to do next , or in the future .
ESFJ	no one is going to try to fill my mother s shoes , what she did was fantastic . it s about making your own future and your own destiny and kate will do a very good job of that .
ENTJ	what we are discussing privately and publicly , is a budget which is a blueprint for the future which creates jobs , which educates our children , which provides healthcare for all americans , which takes our deficit down , which gives a tax cut for 95 % of the american people .
INFP	the people in charge , globally , are maniacs . they are maniacs , and unless we do something about it these people are going to deprive us of a future .
ENTJ	the claim made by team obama that every dollar in stimulus translates into a dollar-and-a-half in growth is economic fiction . the costs of stimulus reduce future growth . no country has ever spent itself to prosperity . the price of stimulus has to be paid sometime .
ESTJ	i am a big laser believer - i really think they are the wave of the future .
ISFP	i have been doing musical theater since i was a kid . and look for a cd from me in the future . i want to write all the songs !
ISTJ	the euro is our common fate , and europe is our common future .
ENTJ	we inadvertently bombed the chinese embassy . but clinton now is working very hard . he has sent a letter of apology to the chinese . and , he s also given them a gift certificate for future nuclear secrets .
ESTP	as much as we all talk about the future and how so many things are merging , there is a simplicity that is crucial .
ISTP	i really hope that we will have a sustainable future on this planet , i really do . so i probably geek out mostly about learning more about how potentially we can hopefully make that happen , hopefully we are not too far lost .
ENFP	i am already the most fortunate girl in the world , so i have zero expectations for what the future will bring .
ISTP	whether they run a record company or a grocery store , every boss will tell you you are in big trouble if you are borrowing more than you can ever afford to pay back . delaying the pain for future generations is suicidal . we have got to start getting the deficit down right now , not next year .
INFP	i suppose i am intrigued with the bad traits of society , because i am a part of society , and the bad traits pose the dangerous questions for our future .
INFP	we kinda look at this as the second or third chapter of our lives . after college , most people figure out what they want to do with their lives . but we already know what we want to do in the future and that is to continue to further our business goals .
ESFJ	you never know what the future brings .
ENTP	we must cultivate our own garden . when man was put in the garden of eden he was put there so that he should work , which proves that man was not born to rest .
ENFP	i do not like formal gardens . i like wild nature . it s just the wilderness instinct in me , i guess .
ISTJ	to dwell is to garden .
ESFJ	i loathe gardening , but i love gardens , and i have two beautiful gardens . i can not bear gardening , but i love gardens .
INTP	sir , my concern is not whether god is on our side my greatest concern is to be on god s side , for god is always right .
ISFJ	we need to find god , and he can not be found in noise and restlessness . god is the friend of silence . see how nature - trees , flowers , grass- grows in silence see the stars , the moon and the sun , how they move in silence ... we need silence to be able to touch souls .
INTP	when the solution is simple , god is answering .
INFJ	god , as truth , has been for me a treasure beyond price . may he be so to every one of us .
ESTJ	the christian life is not a constant high . i have my moments of deep discouragement . i have to go to god in prayer with tears in my eyes , and say , o god , forgive me ,  or help me . 
INFJ	each one prays to god according to his own light .
INFJ	god is , even though the whole world deny him . truth stands , even if there be no public support . it is self-sustained .
ESTJ	god has given us two hands , one to receive with and the other to give with .
INTP	the bible is one of the greatest blessings bestowed by god on the children of men . it has god for its author salvation for its end , and truth without any mixture for its matter . it is all pure .
ENFJ	god who is eternally complete , who directs the stars , who is the master of fates , who elevates man from his lowliness to himself , who speaks from the cosmos to every single human soul , is the most brilliant manifestation of the goal of perfection .
ENFP	there s only one effectively redemptive sacrifice , the sacrifice of self-will to make room for the knowledge of god .
ESFP	throughout life people will make you mad , disrespect you and treat you bad . let god deal with the things they do , cause hate in your heart will consume you too .
ENFP	only one thing is impossible for god : to find any sense in any copyright law on the planet .
ESFP	if we ever forget that we are one nation under god , then we will be a nation gone under .
ISTJ	it is impossible to rightly govern a nation without god and the bible .
INFP	i would rather live my life as if there is a god and die to find out there is not , than live my life as if there is not and die to find out there is .
INFP	i believe in god , but not as one thing , not as an old man in the sky . i believe that what people call god is something in all of us . i believe that what jesus and mohammed and buddha and all the rest said was right . it s just that the translations have gone wrong .
ENFJ	i just want to do god s will . and he s allowed me to go to the mountain . and i have looked over , and i have seen the promised land ! i may not get there with you , but i want you to know tonight that we as a people will get to the promised land .
INFP	god has given you one face , and you make yourself another .
INFJ	i tremble for my country when i reflect that god is just that his justice can not sleep forever .
INTP	i can not imagine a god who rewards and punishes the objects of his creation and is but a reflection of human frailty .
INTP	with malice toward none , with charity for all , with firmness in the right , as god gives us to see the right , let us strive on to finish the work we are in , to bind up the nation s wounds .
ISFJ	let us more and more insist on raising funds of love , of kindness , of understanding , of peace . money will come if we seek first the kingdom of god - the rest will be given .
INTP	god does not play dice .
INTP	i do not believe in the god of theology who rewards good and punishes evil .
INTP	i shall never believe that god plays dice with the world .
INTP	we should take care not to make the intellect our god it has , of course , powerful muscles , but no personality .
INTP	morality is of the highest importance - but for us , not for god .
INTP	god may be subtle , but he is not plain mean .
INFP	ignorance is the curse of god knowledge is the wing wherewith we fly to heaven .
ESFP	geography has made us neighbors . history has made us friends . economics has made us partners , and necessity has made us allies . those whom god has so joined together , let no man put asunder .
ISFJ	there is always the danger that we may just do the work for the sake of the work . this is where the respect and the love and the devotion come in - that we do it to god , to christ , and that s why we try to do it as beautifully as possible .
INTP	surely god would not have created such a being as man , with an ability to grasp the infinite , to exist only for a day ! no , no , man was made for immortality .
ISFJ	i try to give to the poor people for love what the rich could get for money . no , i would not touch a leper for a thousand pounds yet i willingly cure him for the love of god .

ESFP	if you are not willing to work hard , let someone else do it . i d rather be with someone who does a horrible job , but gives 110 % than with someone who does a good job and gives 60 % .

INTJ	you say it is the good cause that hallows even war ? i say unto you : it is the good war that hallows any cause .
ENTP	a return to first principles in a republic is sometimes caused by the simple virtues of one man . his good example has such an influence that the good men strive to imitate him , and the wicked are ashamed to lead a life so contrary to his example .

ISTP	i met woz when i was 13 , at a friend s garage . he was about 18 . he was , like , the first person i met who knew more electronics than i did at that point . we became good friends , because we shared an interest in computer and we had a sense of humor . we pulled all kinds of pranks together .

INTP	dedicate yourself to the good you deserve and desire for yourself . give yourself peace of mind . you deserve to be happy . you deserve delight .
ISFJ	julia progresses from cradle to grave , showing how government makes every good thing in her life possible . the weak economy , high unemployment , falling wages , rising gas prices , the national debt , the insolvency of entitlements - all these are fictionally assumed away in a cartoon that is produced by a president who wants us to forget about them .
ISTJ	i was not in school often enough to really belong to a clique ,  but my friends all studied hard and got pretty good grades . they were good people with self-respect . i still like to be friends with people i admire something about i really believe that we become like the people we are surrounded by , so i choose my friends carefully !
ISFJ	what does it say about a president s policies when he has to use a cartoon character rather than real people to justify his record ? what does it say about the fiction of old liberalism to insist that good jobs and good schools and good wages will result from policies that have failed us , time and again ?
ISFJ	and that s how it is in america . we look to our communities , our faiths , our families for our joy , our support , in good times and bad . it is both how we live our lives and why we live our lives .

ENFP	everyone who wants to do good to the human race always ends in universal bullying .
ESTP	it s always good to be underestimated .
INTJ	it is no good getting furious if you get stuck . what i do is keep thinking about the problem but work on something else . sometimes it is years before i see the way forward . in the case of information loss and black holes , it was 29 years .
ESTP	if it s a good movie , the sound could go off and the audience would still have a perfectly clear idea of what was going on .

INFP	four legs good , two legs bad .

ESFP	the good old days , when each idea had an owner , are gone forever .

INFP	war is war . the only good human being is a dead one .
INFP	active evil is better than passive good .
ENFJ	hope is a state of mind , not of the world . hope , in this deep and powerful sense , is not the same as joy that things are going well , or willingness to invest in enterprises that are obviously heading for success , but rather an ability to work for something because it is good .
ESFJ	i like a man who can be a real friend , has a good sense of humor , a good pair of shoes and a healthy gold card .
INFP	ladies , if you want to know the way to my heart ... good spelling and good grammar , good punctuation , capitalize only where you are supposed to capitalize , it s done .

ENTP	man is a credulous animal , and must believe something in the absence of good grounds for belief , he will be satisfied with bad ones .

INFP	men are only as good as their technical development allows them to be .
INTJ	a good day is one where i can not just read a book , but write a review of it . maybe today i will be able to do that . i get for some reason somewhat stronger when the sun starts to go down . dusk is a good time for me . i am crepuscular .
ENTP	the most savage controversies are about matters as to which there is no good evidence either way .
ENFP	i have gone for each type : the rough guy the nerdy , sweet , lovable guy and the slick guy . i do not really have a type . men in general are a good thing .
ESFP	but the real secret to lifelong good health is actually the opposite : let your body take care of you .
INFP	there s no regret . you ca not regret . i mean , i have felt regret but i have also refused to allow regret to sow a seed and live in me because i do not believe it . you feel it , it s like guilt , it s like jealousy , it s like all those horrible things . you have just got to snip them and get them out , because they are no good .
INFJ	i hope we shall crush in its birth the aristocracy of our monied corporations which dare already to challenge our government to a trial by strength , and bid defiance to the laws of our country .
ISTJ	government is not reason it is not eloquent it is force . like fire , it is a dangerous servant and a fearful master .

ISTJ	the marvel of all history is the patience with which men and women submit to burdens unnecessarily laid upon them by their governments .
INTP	knowledge will forever govern ignorance and a people who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives .
ENTP	laws too gentle are seldom obeyed too severe , seldom executed .
INTJ	the government , which was designed for the people , has got into the hands of the bosses and their employers , the special interests . an invisible empire has been set up above the forms of democracy .
ESTP	it is to be regretted that the rich and powerful too often bend the acts of government to their own selfish purposes .
INTP	so that the record of history is absolutely crystal clear . that there is no alternative way , so far discovered , of improving the lot of the ordinary people that can hold a candle to the productive activities that are unleashed by a free enterprise system .
INTP	the government solution to a problem is usually as bad as the problem .
ENTP	what i worry about would be that you essentially have two chambers , the house and the senate , but you have simply , majoritarian , absolute power on either side . and that s just not what the founders intended .

INTP	governments never learn . only people learn .
ESTP	the people are the government , administering it by their agents they are the government , the sovereign power .

INFJ	my reading of history convinces me that most bad government results from too much government .
INTP	this country , with its institutions , belongs to the people who inhabit it . whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government , they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it , or exercise their revolutionary right to overthrow it .
INTP	any people anywhere , being inclined and having the power , have the right to rise up , and shake off the existing government , and form a new one that suits them better . this is a most valuable - a most sacred right - a right , which we hope and believe , is to liberate the world .
ENFP	patriotism is supporting your country all the time , and your government when it deserves it .
ESFP	man is not free unless government is limited .
ESFP	government exists to protect us from each other . where government has gone beyond its limits is in deciding to protect us from ourselves .
ESFP	no government ever voluntarily reduces itself in size . government programs , once launched , never disappear . actually , a government bureau is the nearest thing to eternal life we will ever see on this earth !
ESFP	government s view of the economy could be summed up in a few short phrases : if it moves , tax it . if it keeps moving , regulate it . and if it stops moving , subsidize it .
ESFP	government s first duty is to protect the people , not run their lives .
INTP	government of the people , by the people , for the people , shall not perish from the earth .
INFJ	a bill of rights is what the people are entitled to against every government , and what no just government should refuse , or rest on inference .
INTP	nothing is more destructive of respect for the government and the law of the land than passing laws which can not be enforced .
INTP	if you put the federal government in charge of the sahara desert , in 5 years there d be a shortage of sand .
ESFP	the problem is not that people are taxed too little , the problem is that government spends too much .
INTP	the philosophy of the school room in one generation will be the philosophy of government in the next .
INTJ	we are fast approaching the stage of the ultimate inversion : the stage where the government is free to do anything it pleases , while the citizens may act only by permission which is the stage of the darkest periods of human history , the stage of rule by brute force .

ESFP	government does not solve problems it subsidizes them .
INTJ	our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people . it is wholly inadequate to the government of any other .
ESTP	let us never forget that government is ourselves and not an alien power over us . the ultimate rulers of our democracy are not a president and senators and congressmen and government officials , but the voters of this country .
ESFP	government is like a baby . an alimentary canal with a big appetite at one end and no sense of responsibility at the other .
ESTP	it has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except all the others that have been tried .
INFJ	the republican is the only form of government which is not eternally at open or secret war with the rights of mankind .
INFJ	were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers , or newspapers without a government , i should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter .
INFJ	the spirit of resistance to government is so valuable on certain occasions that i wish it to be always kept alive .
INFJ	sometimes it is said that man can not be trusted with the government of himself . can he , then be trusted with the government of others ? or have we found angels in the form of kings to govern him ? let history answer this question .
INFJ	history , in general , only informs us of what bad government is .
ISTJ	in the councils of government , we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence , whether sought or unsought , by the military-industrial complex . the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist .
ESTP	when i am abroad , i always make it a rule never to criticize or attack the government of my own country . i make up for lost time when i come home .
INFJ	the natural progress of things is for liberty to yield and government to gain ground .
INFJ	conquest is not in our principles . it is inconsistent with our government .
INTJ	potentially , a government is the most dangerous threat to man s rights : it holds a legal monopoly on the use of physical force against legally disarmed victims .
ESFP	democracy is worth dying for , because it s the most deeply honorable form of government ever devised by man .
INFJ	i own that i am not a friend to a very energetic government . it is always oppressive .
INFJ	so confident am i in the intentions , as well as wisdom , of the government , that i shall always be satisfied that what is not done , either can not , or ought not to be done .

ESFP	one way to make sure crime does not pay would be to let the government run it .
ESFP	protecting the rights of even the least individual among us is basically the only excuse the government has for even existing .
ISTJ	over grown military establishments are under any form of government inauspicious to liberty , and are to be regarded as particularly hostile to republican liberty .
INTJ	the only power any government has is the power to crack down on criminals . well , when there are not enough criminals , one makes them . one declares so many things to be a crime that it becomes impossible for men to live without breaking laws .
ESFP	today , if you invent a better mousetrap , the government comes along with a better mouse .
ISTJ	i think that people want peace so much that one of these days government had better get out of their way and let them have it .
ENTJ	different men seek after happiness in different ways and by different means , and so make for themselves different modes of life and forms of government .
ISTJ	the basis of our political system is the right of the people to make and to alter their constitutions of government .
ISTP	when the federal government spends more each year than it collects in tax revenues , it has three choices : it can raise taxes , print money , or borrow money . while these actions may benefit politicians , all three options are bad for average americans .
ENTP	if the people can not trust their government to do the job for which it exists - to protect them and to promote their common welfare - all else is lost .
ISTJ	mankind , when left to themselves , are unfit for their own government .
ISTP	if you like small government you need to work hard at having a strong national defense that is not so militant . personal liberty is the purpose of government , to protect liberty - not to run your personal life , not to run the economy , and not to pretend that we can tell the world how they ought to live .
INFP	by definition , a government has no conscience . sometimes it has a policy , but nothing more .
ISTJ	it may be laid down as a primary position , and the basis of our system , that every citizen who enjoys the protection of a free government , owes not only a proportion of his property , but even of his personal services to the defense of it .
ESTP	the government is us we are the government , you and i .

ISTP	i believe there is something out there watching us . unfortunately , it s the government .
ISFJ	now , let me be clear . the path i lay out is not one paved with ever increasing government checks and cradle to grave assurance that government will always be the solution . if this election is a bidding war for who can promise the most goodies and the most benefits , i am not your president . you have that president today .
ENFJ	there are many people who feel that it is useless and futile to continue talking about peace and non-violence against a government whose only reply is savage attacks on an unarmed and defenceless people .
INTP	many people want the government to protect the consumer . a much more urgent problem is to protect the consumer from the government .
INTJ	there is danger from all men . the only maxim of a free government ought to be to trust no man living with power to endanger the public liberty .
ISFJ	i spent my whole life in the private sector , 25 years in the private sector . i understand that when government takes more money out of the hands of people , it makes it more difficult for them to buy things . if they ca not buy things , the economy does not grow . if the economy does not grow , we do not put americans to work .
INTP	the great depression , like most other periods of severe unemployment , was produced by government mismanagement rather than by any inherent instability of the private economy .

ISTP	when one gets in bed with government , one must expect the diseases it spreads .
ISTP	i am absolutely opposed to a national id card . this is a total contradiction of what a free society is all about . the purpose of government is to protect the secrecy and the privacy of all individuals , not the secrecy of government . we do not need a national id card .
ENTP	the internet did not get invented on its own . government research created the internet so that all the companies could make money off the internet . the point is , is that when we succeed , we succeed because of our individual initiative , but also because we do things together .
INTJ	the happiness of society is the end of government .
ENTP	the ideal form of government is democracy tempered with assassination .
ISFJ	government is taking 40 percent of the gdp . and that s at the state , local and federal level . president obama has taken government spending at the federal level from 20 percent to 25 percent . look , at some point , you cease being a free economy , and you become a government economy . and we have got to stop that .
ISTP	i am not really conservative . i am conservative on certain things . i believe in less government . i believe in fiscal responsibility and all those things that maybe republicans used to believe in but do not any more .
ISTP	there is nothing wrong with describing conservatism as protecting the constitution , protecting all things that limit government . government is the enemy of liberty . government should be very restrained .
ISFJ	and a special thank you to the citizens of massachusetts : you are paying all the taxes , creating all the jobs , raising all the children . this government is yours . thank you for letting me serve you . i love this job .
INTP	the world runs on individuals pursuing their self interests . the great achievements of civilization have not come from government bureaus . einstein did not construct his theory under order from a , from a bureaucrat . henry ford did not revolutionize the automobile industry that way .

ESTP	the united states constitution has proved itself the most marvelously elastic compilation of rules of government ever written .
INTJ	liberty has never come from government . liberty has always come from the subjects of it . the history of liberty is a history of limitations of governmental power , not the increase of it .
ENTJ	why has government been instituted at all ? because the passions of man will not conform to the dictates of reason and justice without constraint .

INTP	nothing is so permanent as a temporary government program .
ISFJ	the right way to reign in healthcare costs is not by applying more government and more controls and making it more like the post office , it s by making it more like a consumer-driven market .
ISFJ	you balance the budget by restraining the growth of government and encouraging the growth of the private sector .
ISFJ	by making bold cuts in spending and commonsense entitlement reforms , we will make our government simpler , smaller , and smarter .
ISFJ	it s opportunity . it s opportunity , not a check from government - it s opportunity that has always driven america and defined us as americans .
ISFJ	the answer for healthcare is market incentives , not healthcare by a godzilla-sized government bureaucracy .
ISFJ	i would cap the amount of federal government can spend at 20 percent of the economy . bring it back to 20 percent or lower . and say , we are not going to spend above that level . democrats , they want to raise your taxes and spend more and more and turn us into an economy which is no longer driven by the private sector .
ISFJ	our nation is too different , too diverse to say that what works in massachusetts is somehow going to be grabbed by the federal government , usurping the power of states and imposing a one-size-fits-all plan on the nation . that will not work .
ISFJ	on one of the most personal matters of our lives , our health care , president obama would turn decision making over to government bureaucrats . he forced through obama-care and i will repeal it .
ISFJ	democrats want to use the slowdown as an excuse to do what their special interests are always begging for : higher taxes , bigger government and less trade with other nations .
ESTP	no government can help the destinies of people who insist in putting sectional and class consciousness ahead of general weal .
ISTP	i had the privilege of practicing medicine in the early 60s , before we had any government . it worked rather well , and there was nobody on the street suffering with no medical care .
ENTJ	well private money can take risks in a way that government money often is not willing to .
ENTP	all government , indeed every human benefit and enjoyment , every virtue , and every prudent act , is founded on compromise and barter .

ESFJ	the federal government has sponsored research that has produced a tomato that is perfect in every respect , except that you ca not eat it . we should make every effort to make sure this disease , often referred to as progress  , does not spread .
ESTJ	as i speak to you today , government censors somewhere are working furiously to erase my words from the records of history . but history itself has already condemned these tactics .
INTJ	a little group of willful men , representing no opinion but their own , have rendered the great government of the united states helpless and contemptible .
ESTJ	one of my goals upon becoming secretary of state was to take diplomacy out of capitals , out of government offices , into the media , into the streets of countries .

INFJ	if you are working 50 hours a week in a factory , you do not have time to read 10 newspapers a day and go back to declassified government archives . but such people may have far-reaching insights into the way the world works .
ENTP	nothing turns out to be so oppressive and unjust as a feeble government .
ENTJ	you know why there s a second amendment ? in case the government fails to follow the first one .
INTJ	while all other sciences have advanced , that of government is at a standstill - little better understood , little better practiced now than three or four thousand years ago .
ESFJ	i do not think the government is out to get me or help someone else get me but it would not surprise me if they were out to sell me something or help someone else sell me something . i mean , why else would the census bureau want to know my telephone number ?
INTP	and i have no doubt that every new example will succeed , as every past one has done , in showing that religion and government will both exist in greater purity , the less they are mixed together .
ESTP	as long as our government is administered for the good of the people , and is regulated by their will as long as it secures to us the rights of persons and of property , liberty of conscience and of the press , it will be worth defending .

INTJ	by a continuing process of inflation , government can confiscate , secretly and unobserved , an important part of the wealth of their citizens .
ESFJ	when you decide to get involved in a military operation in a place like syria , you have got to be prepared , as we learned from iraq and afghanistan , to become the government , and i am not sure any country , either the united states or i do not hear of anyone else , who s willing to take on that responsibility .
INTP	the most important ways in which i think the internet will affect the big issue is that it will make it more difficult for government to collect taxes .
INTP	i have no doubt but that the misery of the lower classes will be found to abate whenever the government assumes a freer aspect and the laws favor a subdivision of property .

INTJ	i feel good because i believe i have made progress in rebuilding the people s trust in their government .
INTJ	as president , reagan worked very well with democrats to do big things . it is true that he worked to reduce the size of government and cut federal taxes and he eliminated many regulations , but he also raised taxes when necessary .
INTP	the diversity in the faculties of men , from which the rights of property originate , is not less an insuperable obstacle to an uniformity of interests . the protection of these faculties is the first object of government .
INTP	what is government itself but the greatest of all reflections on human nature ? if men were angels , no government would be necessary . if angels were to govern men , neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary .
INTP	to suppose that any form of government will secure liberty or happiness without any virtue in the people , is a chimerical idea .
ESFJ	a politician is a man who understands government . a statesman is a politician who s been dead for 15 years .

INTP	the rights of persons , and the rights of property , are the objects , for the protection of which government was instituted .
ENTJ	barack obama s enemies are the people who make this country work . barack obama s enemies are those who succeed . those are the people whose income he wants to redistribute . those are the people whose income he wants to take , using the power and the force of the federal government to do it .

ESTP	we should reject big government and look inside ourselves for all the things that built this country into what it was .
ESTJ	the control of information is something the elite always does , particularly in a despotic form of government . information , knowledge , is power . if you can control information , you can control people .
ESTP	people forget ... that we structured it so that the government , or the people , would be repaid with a really good rate of return . and as it turns out , that aspect of tarp , that s what happened .

ENTP	every wise , just , and mild government , by rendering the condition of its subjects easy and secure , will always abound most in people , as well as in commodities and riches .
INTJ	democracy is not so much a form of government as a set of principles .
INFJ	in the late 1990s , some of the worst terrorist atrocities in the world were what the turkish government itself called state terror , namely massive atrocities , 80 percent of the arms coming from the united states , millions of refugees , tens of thousands of people killed , hideous repression , that s international terror , and we can go on and on .
ISFJ	i ca not really criticize the tea party people , because i came into the white house pretty much on the same basis that they have become popular . that is dissatisfaction with the way things are going in washington and disillusionment and disencouragement about the government .
ESFJ	to reduce deficit spending and our enormous debt , you reign in spending . you cut the budget . you do not take more from the private sector and grow government with it . and that s exactly what obama has in mind with this expiration of bush tax cuts proposal of his .

ENTP	it is time we passed a balanced budget amendment and return this government to limited spending .
ENTP	the time has come to tell the truth about the corruption of the government employee unions in this country .
ENTP	surely the president can agree with us , that theft from government is not good . i know it s bold . it s out on the edge . i know from a chicago-springfield background it s hard to fully grasp that honesty could be part of government .

ENFJ	power without principle is barren , but principle without power is futile . this is a party of government , and i will lead it as a party of government .
ESFJ	common sense tells us that the government s attempts to solve large problems more often create new ones . common sense also tells us that a top-down , one-size-fits-all plan will not improve the workings of a nationwide health-care system that accounts for one-sixth of our economy .

ISFP	the applause was so loud and insistent that i had to respond with several encores . i was numb with happiness , when it was over , i knew that this alone must be my life and my world .
ESFP	the way you think , the way you behave , the way you eat , can influence your life by 30 to 50 years .
ESFP	i made a commitment to completely cut out drinking and anything that might hamper me from getting my mind and body together . and the floodgates of goodness have opened upon me - spiritually and financially .
ESTJ	we can make a commitment to promote vegetables and fruits and whole grains on every part of every menu . we can make portion sizes smaller and emphasize quality over quantity . and we can help create a culture - imagine this - where our kids ask for healthy options instead of resisting them .
INTJ	my body is like breakfast , lunch , and dinner . i do not think about it , i just have it .
INTP	the devil has put a penalty on all things we enjoy in life . either we suffer in health or we suffer in soul or we get fat .
ENFP	be careful about reading health books . you may die of a misprint .
ENFP	the only way to keep your health is to eat what you do not want , drink what you do not like , and do what you d rather not .
ESTJ	when wealth is lost , nothing is lost when health is lost , something is lost when character is lost , all is lost .
ENTP	after a century of striving , after a year of debate , after a historic vote , health care reform is no longer an unmet promise . it is the law of the land .
ENTP	and so our goal on health care is , if we can get , instead of health care costs going up 6 percent a year , it s going up at the level of inflation , maybe just slightly above inflation , we have made huge progress . and by the way , that is the single most important thing we could do in terms of reducing our deficit . that s why we did it .
ENTJ	obama s health care plan will be written by a committee whose head , john conyers , says he does not understand it . it will be passed by congress that has not read it , signed by a president who smokes , funded by a treasury chief who did not pay his taxes , overseen by a surgeon general who is obese , and financed by a country that s nearly broke . what could possibly go wrong ?
ENTP	but if you - if what - the reports are true , what they are saying is , is that as a consequence of us getting 30 million additional people health care , at the margins that s going to increase our costs , we knew that .
ESTJ	women in particular need to keep an eye on their physical and mental health , because if we are scurrying to and from appointments and errands , we do not have a lot of time to take care of ourselves . we need to do a better job of putting ourselves higher on our own to do  list .
ENFP	addiction should never be treated as a crime . it has to be treated as a health problem . we do not send alcoholics to jail in this country . over 500,000 people are in our jails who are nonviolent drug users .
ISTP	overnight stardom can be harmful to your mental health . yeah . it has ruined a lot of people .
INTP	all mankind ... being all equal and independent , no one ought to harm another in his life , health , liberty or possessions .
INTJ	capital is reckless of the health or length of life of the laborer , unless under compulsion from society .
ESFJ	the chief condition on which , life , health and vigor depend on , is action . it is by action that an organism develops its faculties , increases its energy , and attains the fulfillment of its destiny .
ENTP	if you can be well without health , you may be happy without virtue .
ESTP	i support health care for people . i want people well taken care of . but i also want health care that we can afford as a country . i have people and friends closing down their businesses because of obamacare .
INTJ	i believe in universal health care . and i am not afraid to say so .
ENFP	i have never had very high regard for therapists . i owe my health , my mental survival , to my friends and loved ones .
ISFJ	the awareness that health is dependent upon habits that we control makes us the first generation in history that to a large extent determines its own destiny .
ESFP	in societies where mature workers are respected and where their wisdom is respected , everybody benefits . workers are more engaged and productive . their health is better . they live longer .
ESTJ	when it comes to the health of our families , barack refused to listen to all those folks who told him to leave health reform for another day , another president . he did not care whether it was the easy thing to do politically - that s not how he was raised - he cared that it was the right thing to do .
ESTP	it s bizarre that the produce manager is more important to my children s health than the pediatrician .
ISFJ	the fact is that we would have had comprehensive health care now , had it not been for ted kennedy s deliberately blocking the legislation that i proposed in 1978 or 79 .
ISFJ	i think all americans believe in human rights . and health is an often overlooked aspect of basic human rights . and it s one that s easily corrected . the reason i say that is that many of the diseases that we treat around the world , i knew when i was a child . my mother was a registered nurse . and they no longer exist in our country .
ENTP	i think it s horrible that people have to be told . do not smoke ! everybody knows it s bad for the health . but they have to forbid it .
ENTP	there are less than 1 per cent of anorexic girls , but there more than 30 per cent of girls in france - i do not know about england - that are much , much overweight . and it is much more dangerous and very bad for the health .
ENFJ	america does not have health insurance .
ENTJ	in order to lead a country or a company , you have got to get everybody on the same page and you have got to be able to have a vision of where you are going . america ca not have a vision of health care for everybody , green economy , regulations - ca not have a bunch of piece-meal activities . it s got to have a vision .
ENFJ	if i were a capitalist i would not give my employees health insurance with no deductible , which i do , including dental , and paid pregnancy leave . that s not called capitalism , that s called being a christian and someone who believes in democracy , so that everyone should get a fair slice of the pie .
ENTJ	dick cheney said he was running again . he said his health was fine , i have got a doctor with me 24 hours a day .  yeah , that s always the sign of a man in good health , is not it ?
ENTJ	think of an economy where people could be an artist or a photographer or a writer without worrying about keeping their day job in order to have health insurance .
ENTJ	i think about my parents all the time , especially on sunday when i am at mass . my mother always said , we do not pray to win elections . we pray for people s health , we pray that god s will be done , we pray that we do our best . but we do not pray to win elections . 
ENTJ	because of the president s leadership , every american will have access to affordable , quality health care .
ESFJ	make no mistake , a yes  vote on the democrats  health care bill is a vote for taxpayer-funded abortions .
ESFP	the public health of five million children should not be left to luck or chance .
ESTJ	well , the truth is that a lot of people lie about their health , they lie about the finances , they lie about things at work , they lie about things .
ESTJ	when bureaucrats talk about increasing our access  to x , y or z , what they are really talking about is increasing exponentially their control over our lives . as it is with the government health care takeover , so it is with the newly approved government plan to increase  internet access . 
ESTJ	for the past two years , president obama has promised our children the moon , stars , rainbows , unicorns and universal health care for all . but the white house santa s cradle-to-grave entitlement mandates are a spectacularly predictable bust .
ESFP	if obama wanted to make radical changes to america s health long-term , all he has to do is treble the price of sugar and salt .
INTJ	i admit it : i had fun watching right-wingers go wild as health reform finally became law .
ESFP	i am in very good health . i have never felt better .
INTP	if your access to health care involves your leaving work and driving somewhere and parking and waiting for a long time , that s not going to promote healthiness .
INTP	the dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present . the occasion is piled high with difficulty , and we must rise with the occasion . as our case is new , so we must think anew and act anew .
ESTP	the test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much it is whether we provide enough for those who have little .
ENFP	the very ink with which history is written is merely fluid prejudice .
ESTP	history will be kind to me for i intend to write it .
ESTP	study history , study history . in history lies all the secrets of statecraft .
ESFJ	if you are neutral in situations of injustice , you have chosen the side of the oppressor . if an elephant has its foot on the tail of a mouse and you say that you are neutral , the mouse will not appreciate your neutrality .
ESFP	if we can not now end our differences , at least we can help make the world safe for diversity .
ESFP	we would like to live as we once lived , but history will not permit it .
ENTJ	democratic nations must try to find ways to starve the terrorist and the hijacker of the oxygen of publicity on which they depend .
ENTJ	i came , i saw , i conquered .

ENTP	those who do not know history are destined to repeat it .
ESTP	a pint of sweat , saves a gallon of blood .
ESTP	americans love to fight . all real americans love the sting of battle .
ESTJ	history is more or less bunk .
ENFP	that men do not learn very much from the lessons of history is the most important of all the lessons of history .
ENTJ	history is the version of past events that people have decided to agree upon .
ESTP	if one morning i walked on top of the water across the potomac river , the headline that afternoon would read : president ca not swim . 
ENTJ	what is history but a fable agreed upon ?
ENTJ	glory is fleeting , but obscurity is forever .
ESFJ	the marine corps is the navy s police force and as long as i am president that is what it will remain . they have a propaganda machine that is almost equal to stalin s .
ESTP	being president is like being a jackass in a hailstorm . there s nothing to do but to stand there and take it .
ISTJ	the most terrible job in warfare is to be a second lieutenant leading a platoon when you are on the battlefield .
ESFJ	90 percent of my time is spent on 10 percent of the world .
ISTJ	i have noticed that nothing i never said ever did me any harm .
ESTP	they died hard , those savage men - like wounded wolves at bay . they were filthy , and they were lousy , and they stunk . and i loved them .
ESTP	the greater the difficulty , the more the glory in surmounting it .
ESTP	the deliberate and deadly attacks which were carried out yesterday against our country were more than acts of terror . they were acts of war .
ESTP	could i have but a line a century hence crediting a contribution to the advance of peace , i would yield every honor which has been accorded by war .
INFJ	be as a tower firmly set shakes not its top for any blast that blows .
INTJ	the man who is swimming against the stream knows the strength of it .
ENFJ	we , therefore , here in britain stand shoulder to shoulder with our american friends in this hour of tragedy , and we , like them , will not rest until this evil is driven from our world .
ISFJ	something as curious as the monarchy wo not survive unless you take account of people s attitudes . after all , if people do not want it , they wo not have it .
ENFJ	we are not makers of history . we are made by history .
INFJ	among the many misdeeds of the british rule in india , history will look upon the act depriving a whole nation of arms as the blackest .
ESTP	history is written by the victors .
ESTP	for my part , i consider that it will be found much better by all parties to leave the past to history , especially as i propose to write that history myself .
INTJ	history repeats itself , first as tragedy , second as farce .
INFJ	violent men have not been known in history to die to a man . they die up to a point .
ESFP	history teaches that war begins when governments believe the price of aggression is cheap .
ENTJ	poetry is finer and more philosophical than history for poetry expresses the universal , and history only the particular .
ENTJ	hence poetry is something more philosophic and of graver import than history , since its statements are rather of the nature of universals , whereas those of history are singulars .
INTJ	in the course of history , men come to see that iron necessity is neither iron nor necessary .
ENTJ	history is a set of lies agreed upon .
INFP	to correct a natural indifference i was placed half-way between misery and the sun . misery kept me from believing that all was well under the sun , and the sun taught me that history was not everything .
ESTP	never throughout history has a man who lived a life of ease left a name worth remembering .
INFP	those who weep for the happy periods which they encounter in history acknowledge what they want not the alleviation but the silencing of misery .
ESTP	there has never yet been a man in our history who led a life of ease whose name is worth remembering .
ISTP	woz is living his own life now . he has not been around apple for about five years . but what he did will go down in history .
ENTJ	europe was created by history . america was created by philosophy .
ENTP	i want to reform the tax code so that it s simple , fair , and asks the wealthiest households to pay higher taxes on incomes over $ 250,000 - the same rate we had when bill clinton was president the same rate we had when our economy created nearly 23 million new jobs , the biggest surplus in history , and a lot of millionaires to boot .
ISTJ	if past history was all there was to the game , the richest people would be librarians .
INTJ	history does nothing it does not possess immense riches , it does not fight battles . it is men , real , living , who do all this .
INTP	in the long history of humankind ( and animal kind , too ) those who learned to collaborate and improvise most effectively have prevailed .
ESTJ	we do not want tradition . we want to live in the present and the only history that is worth a tinker s dam is the history we make today .
ENTP	history is only the register of crimes and misfortunes .
INTJ	the whole history of science has been the gradual realization that events do not happen in an arbitrary manner , but that they reflect a certain underlying order , which may or may not be divinely inspired .
ENTP	we have persevered because of a belief we share with the iraqi people - a belief that out of the ashes of war , a new beginning could be born in this cradle of civilization . through this remarkable chapter in the history of the united states and iraq , we have met our responsibility . now , it s time to turn the page .
ENTP	i would put our legislative and foreign policy accomplishments in our first two years against any president - with the possible exceptions of johnson , fdr , and lincoln - just in terms of what we have gotten done in modern history . but , you know , but when it comes to the economy , we have got a lot more work to do . and we are gon na keep on at it .
ENTP	indeed , history is nothing more than a tableau of crimes and misfortunes .
ENTP	history should be written as philosophy .
ISFJ	president barack obama has stood watch over the greatest job loss in modern american history . and that , my friends , is one inconvenient truth that will haunt this president throughout history .
ESTP	the point in history at which we stand is full of promise and danger . the world will either move forward toward unity and widely shared prosperity - or it will move apart .
INTJ	it is not history which uses men as a means of achieving - as if it were an individual person - its own ends . history is nothing but the activity of men in pursuit of their ends .
ENFP	men do not learn much from the lessons of history and that is the most important of all the lessons of history .
INFP	for most of history , anonymous was a woman .
ENFP	de sade is the one completely consistent and thoroughgoing revolutionary of history .
ESTJ	whether a woman s running for office or she s supporting her husband who s running for office and she gets criticised for wearing open-toed shoes or for the colour of her coat , there s just a lot of history that you bear if you are a woman who puts herself out in the political arena .
ENTP	religions , which condemn the pleasures of sense , drive men to seek the pleasures of power . throughout history power has been the vice of the ascetic .
ENTJ	skepticism is a virtue in history as well as in philosophy .
INTJ	the history of all previous societies has been the history of class struggles .

ISTJ	the history of free men is never really written by chance but by choice their choice !
INTJ	the writer may very well serve a movement of history as its mouthpiece , but he can not of course create it .
ISTJ	things have never been more like the way they are today in history .
ENTJ	our nation was created in ways that allow human potential to prosper , and it created the greatest nation for people in the history of humanity . now obama is dismantling it , because he has no appreciation for our greatness . in fact , he resents it . he blames this country for whatever evils he sees around the world .
ESFJ	nixon is one of the few in the history of this country to run for high office talking out of both sides of his mouth at the same time and lying out of both sides .
ESFJ	i do not think we handled the aftermath of the fall of baghdad as well as we might have . but that s now history .
ENFJ	i do not want a black history month . black history is american history .
ENTP	if you think you have it tough , read history books .
INTJ	well , i think that california has had a history of always spending more money than it takes in .
INTP	i am not one of those who wants to purge our society of our christian history .
ESFJ	there is nothing new in the world except the history you do not know .
ENFP	in known history , nobody has had such capacity for altering the universe than the people of the united states of america . and nobody has gone about it in such an aggressive way .
INTJ	ideas shape the course of history .

INTJ	the history of liberty is a history of resistance .
ESFP	i loved history because to me , history was like watching a movie .
ESTP	americans are rising to the tasks of history , and they expect the same of us .
ESTP	presidents quickly realize that while a single act might destroy the world they live in , no one single decision can make life suddenly better or can turn history around for the good .
ESTP	now , there are some who would like to rewrite history - revisionist historians is what i like to call them .
ESFP	i think documentaries are the greatest way to educate an entire generation that does not often look back to learn anything about the history that provided a safe haven for so many of us today .
ESTP	the true history of my administration will be written 50 years from now , and you and i will not be around to see it .
ESTP	i sent american troops to iraq to make its people free , not to make them american . iraqis will write their own history and find their own way .
ESFJ	in its history , europe has committed so many massacres and horrors that it should bow its own head in shame .
INTJ	wasp  is the only ethnic term that is in fact a term of class , apart from redneck , which is another word for the same group but who are in the lower social strata , so it s inexplicably tied up with social standing and culture and history in a way that the other hyphenations just are not .
INFJ	the principle that human nature , in its psychological aspects , is nothing more than a product of history and given social relations removes all barriers to coercion and manipulation by the powerful .
ESTJ	there are still many causes worth sacrificing for , so much history yet to be made .
ENTP	in every election in american history both parties have their cliches . the party that has the cliches that ring true wins .
INTJ	i think the materialist conception of history is valid .
ENFP	throughout human history , the apostles of purity , those who have claimed to possess a total explanation , have wrought havoc among mere mixed-up human beings .
ENFJ	black history is american history .

INTJ	it is like writing history with lightning and my only regret is that it is all so terribly true .
ENTJ	the history of the world shows that peoples and societies do not have to pass through a fixed series of stages in the course of development .
ENTJ	jewelry and pins have been worn throughout history as symbols of power , sending messages . interestingly enough , it was mostly men who wore the jewelry in various times , and obviously crowns were part of signals that were being sent throughout history by people of rank .
ISFJ	the carter center has the only existing international taskforce on disease eradication . which means a total elimination of a disease on the face of the earth . in the history of the world , there s only been one disease eradicated : smallpox . the second disease , i think , is gon na be guinea worm .

INFP	there s something quite exciting when you have a history with somebody and you see them do new and different things .

INFJ	i am not keen on history being tampered with ... to any extent .
ENTP	i want to write a book which is the history of comedy .
ENTJ	if you look at u.s. history through religious history , there is very much a motif that shows the importance religion has played in the u.s. we are a very religious country and it affects the way we look at various political issues .
ESTJ	no country in the history of the world has ever contributed more to humankind and accomplished more for its people in so brief a period of time as israel has done since its relatively recent rebirth in 1948 .
INTP	i thought that all of the sacrifices and blessings of the whole history of mankind have devolved upon me . thank you , god .
ISTJ	but every historical statement and legitimization itself moves within a certain relation to history .
ENFP	the nation is faced with one of the most corporate-orientated anti-consumer congresses in our history .
INTP	it is in the very nature of things human that every act that has once made its appearance and has been recorded in the history of mankind stays with mankind as a potentiality long after its actuality has become a thing of the past .
INTJ	a study of the history of opinion is a necessary preliminary to the emancipation of the mind .
ESTJ	i am really interested in modern history , but to fulfill a history degree at brown you have to do modern and pre-modern .
ENFJ	you are going to relegate my history to a month .
ENTP	i normally ignore the history channel .
ENFJ	over the objections , where they sound like squealing pigs , over the objections of romney and all his allies , we passed some of the toughest wall street regulations in history , turning wall street back into the allocator of capital it always has been and no longer a casino . and they want to repeal it .
ENFJ	there s a lot of revisionist history that goes on these days about iraq .
ENFJ	i graduated from the university of delaware with a double major in history and political science .
ISTJ	whatever can be noted historically can be found within history .
ENFP	if you take a look at history , you will find that the understanding of what is good and evil has always existed before the individual religions . the religions were only invented by people afterwards , in order to express this idea .
ISTP	the subject matter is very tricky . it s about the munich massacre and what mossad did afterwards with the assassination squads . i think it s a turning point in history , especially for the palestinians .
ISTP	it s a huge challenge , a huge responsibility . bond is a huge iconic figure in movie history . these opportunities do not come along very often so i thought , why not ? 
ENFP	in this world without quiet corners , there can be no easy escapes from history , from hullabaloo , from terrible , unquiet fuss .
ENFP	there is a widespread difficulty in the muslim world , which has to do with how the people are taught about examining their own history . a whole range of stuff has been placed off limits .
ENTP	i do not see women and think of them as competition or with judgment . women really move me . i feel connected to all kinds of women . i am angry because i think we have been mistreated throughout history in different countries , including america . i admire women .
INTP	anybody who comes to the cinema is bringing they are whole sexual history , their literary history , their movie literacy , their culture , their language , their religion , whatever they have got . i ca not possibly manipulate all of that , nor do i want to .
INTP	history keeps her secrets longer than most of us . but she has one secret that i will reveal to you tonight in the greatest confidence . sometimes there are no winners at all . and sometimes nobody needs to lose .
ENTJ	when president obama entered the white house , the economy was in a free-fall . the auto industry : on its back . the banks : frozen up . more than three million americans had already lost their jobs . and america s bravest , our men and women in uniform , were fighting what would soon be the longest wars in our history .
ENTJ	in terms of the history of a far reaching movement , 20 years is not that long .
ENTJ	history is always changing .
ESFP	i realise that i do not change the course of history . i am an actor , i do a movie , that s the end of it . you have to realise we are just clowns for hire . after i had success it was great , at first , not to worry about money . it was on my mind when i was growing up .
ENFP	from lies to forgeries the step is not so long , and i have written technical essays on the logic of forgeries and on the influence of forgeries on history .
ENTJ	the president led us into the iraq war on the basis of unproven assertions without evidence he embraced a radical doctrine of pre-emptive war unprecedented in our history and he failed to build a true international coalition .
ENTJ	the american people voted to restore integrity and honesty in washington , d.c. , and the democrats intend to lead the most honest , most open and most ethical congress in history .

INTP	history has not dealt kindly with the aftermath of protracted periods of low risk premiums .
ISTJ	strip malls are history .
ENTJ	everybody knows they are on the obama team : there is not vice presidential vs. presidential division , there s not a generational pull . people have internalized that this is a real moment in history .
ENTJ	i do not want to go negative on franklin delano roosevelt , but he did not pass an economic deal in the first 100 days . we have passed the largest recovery act in the history of the country .
ISFP	i know every note in every song , the whole history of it , even parts that were there and are gone .
ESTJ	we have been a country that s been fortunate to be protected by two oceans , to not have serious attacks on our territory for most of our history . and we were unfortunately reminded in a very devastating way of our vulnerability .

ISFP	if my world were to cave in tomorrow , i would look back on all the pleasures , excitements and worthwhilenesses i have been lucky enough to have had . not the sadness , not my miscarriages or my father leaving home , but the joy of everything else . it will have been enough .
ISFP	say there s a white kid who lives in a nice home , goes to an all-white school , and is pretty much having everything handed to him on a platter - for him to pick up a rap tape is incredible to me , because what that s saying is that he s living a fantasy life of rebellion .
ESFP	it s silly talking about how many years we will have to spend in the jungles of vietnam when we could pave the whole country and put parking stripes on it and still be home by christmas .
ESFP	we should declare war on north vietnam . we could pave the whole country and put parking strips on it , and still be home by christmas .
ISFP	there is just no comparison between having a dinner date with a man and staying home playing canasta with the girls .
ISFP	i did not have nothin  going for me ... school , home ... until i found something i loved , which was music , and that changed everything .
INTJ	an artist has no home in europe except in paris .
ENTP	the instruction we find in books is like fire . we fetch it from our neighbours , kindle it at home , communicate it to others , and it becomes the property of all .
ENTP	so long as i am commander-in-chief , we will sustain the strongest military the world has ever known . when you take off the uniform , we will serve you as well as you have served us - because no one who fights for this country should have to fight for a job , or a roof over their head , or the care that they need when they come home .
ISTP	the most compelling reason for most people to buy a computer for the home will be to link it to a nationwide communications network . we are just in the beginning stages of what will be a truly remarkable breakthrough for most people - as remarkable as the telephone .
ESTJ	my home is in heaven . i am just traveling through this world .
ESTJ	nothing can bring a real sense of security into the home except true love .

ISFP	the land created me . i am wild and lonesome . even as i travel the cities , i am more at home in the vacant lots .
INTJ	if a dog will not come to you after having looked you in the face , you should go home and examine your conscience .
ISTP	basically my wife was immature . i d be at home in the bath and she d come in and sink my boats .
ENTJ	i just owe almost everything to my father and it s passionately interesting for me that the things that i learned in a small town , in a very modest home , are just the things that i believe have won the election .
ISFJ	today s misery is real unemployment , home foreclosures and bankruptcies . this is the obama misery index and its at a record high . its going to take more than new rhetoric to put americans back to work - its going to take a new president .

INFP	the aesthetic came along the way , i think - just through experimenting , and going on tour , and trying stuff out on stage , having fun with it , and not taking it too seriously . if i had a ballgown at home , i d wear it onstage . if i found something in a charity shop , i d wear it . that s where it grew from - just wanting to play dress-up .

ESTJ	my hope is that i will take the good from my experiences and extrapolate them further into areas with which i am unfamiliar . i simply do not know exactly what that difference will be in my judging . but i accept there will be some based on my gender and my latina heritage .
ESFP	you never know what movie i will be in next , but let s just hope it s sells ( for my sake at least ) !
ENTJ	i think by now i have made it fairly clear that i am not very happy with the word hope . i do not believe in people just hoping .
INFP	the other day i got a text from a boy , but it was not hot . i mean , if you are going to text me every day , you have not seen me for months and you are trying to seduce me , you d better spice up that text and make it more exciting than how was your day ? i hope you are having a beautiful one .  sadly , i have not been doing a lot of kissing lately .
ESFP	i have learned from my experiences in this industry that there is absolutely no way to control people s opinions on your performance in your movie . you go out there , promote your film and hope people like the work you did .
ESFJ	i love bono . i really respect what he has done for africa and how he has used his fame to do good in the world . i hope i can do half as much in my life .
ESFJ	i hope by the time i am 30 to have a husband and maybe a baby .
ENTJ	we need to have a pro-growth policy put in place that offers people hope and offers the opportunity for businesses to expand and for them to have confidence in what the world is going to look like for the next two or three or four years with respect to economic policy .
ESFJ	i hope to be around past the 90 s . i do not want to just be categorized as one of this era . my goal is to have a career that stands .
ESFJ	we hope president obama will now respect the will of the people , change course , and commit to making the changes they are demanding . to the extent he is willing to do this , we are ready to work with him .
ESFJ	house and senate republicans are now united in adopting earmark bans . we hope president obama will follow through on his support for an earmark ban by pressing democratic leaders to join house and senate republicans in taking this critical step to restore public trust .
INFP	i love the beatles . i have not named any kids after them but i still really love them . they were the first group that i was ever properly aware of . in my early teens i would sometimes stay in and listen to the radio all day in the hope that i would catch a song by them that i d never heard before and be able to tape it on my radio-cassette player .
INFP	i am proud , and more than a little excited , to be asked to work with faber in an editorial capacity . it is my dearest hope that we will produce some fantastic books together .
ESTP	i hope i can help guys come out and say , all right , dude , i got a manicure ... and i liked it . 
INFJ	no matter how dark things may get in a story , i feel it s the responsibility of the storyteller to leave the audience with at least a shred of hope .
ISTP	to not be self-conscious of your appearance is huge , and something that i desperately hope to carry into film at some point in my useless life - to not be thinking , my ear looks weird from this angle , why is the camera over there ? 
INFP	well , i have been reading a lot about the fifty years since the second world war , about western foreign policy and all that . i try not to let it get to me , but sometimes i just think that there s no hope .
INFJ	like all parents , my husband and i just do the best we can , hold our breath and hope we have set aside enough money for our kid s therapy .
ESFJ	i am moving on . i should have made that clear when i made the announcement . i guess i was not clear . if people think you are leaving a show after all these years , you might be retiring . so i understand where they are coming from , but i should have impressed the fact that i hope i am just moving on right now .
INFP	i would hope everyone would be a feminist .
ISTP	as a young actor , people were trying to define who i was before i really knew that for myself . but i still remember thinking , this is what i love doing , and i hope i am going to be able to do it forever . 
ISFJ	yes , well i really hope i can make a difference , even in the smallest way . i am looking forward to helping as much as i can .
ISFP	you travel with the hope that something unexpected will happen . it has to do with enjoying being lost and figuring it out and the satisfaction . i always get a little disappointed when i know too well where i am going , or when i have lived in a place so long that there s no chance i could possibly get lost .
ESTP	a joke is a very serious thing .
ENFP	humor is mankind s greatest blessing .
INFJ	if i had no sense of humor , i would long ago have committed suicide .

ENTJ	the secret to humor is surprise .

INTJ	i do not think it s possible to have a sense of tragedy without having a sense of humor .
ISFP	and i loved fats waller . i love his instrumental abilities , his vocal abilities and his sense of humor .
INFP	absurdity is what i like most in life , and there s humor in struggling in ignorance . if you saw a man repeatedly running into a wall until he was a bloody pulp , after a while it would make you laugh because it becomes absurd .
INFJ	humor is not a mood but a way of looking at the world . so if it is correct to say that humor was stamped out in nazi germany , that does not mean that people were not in good spirits , or anything of that sort , but something much deeper and more important .
INTP	poor david hume is dying fast , but with more real cheerfulness and good humor and with more real resignation to the necessary course of things , than any whining christian ever dyed with pretended resignation to the will of god .

ESFP	i could not tread these perilous paths in safety , if i did not keep a saving sense of humor .

ENFP	the comic is the perception of the opposite humor is the feeling of it .

ISFJ	there was a time i was very much blaming the way i felt on l.a , that it was a vacuum of creativity , of humor or anything organic , and i was really angry at the place . but then today i feel completely different - i love l.a. !
ISFJ	i am interested not just in projects that i will be starring in , but producing film and tv that s really quality and great for adults and when i say great for adults ,  it does not mean without humor , because i am also interested in doing comedy .

ENFP	disneyland will never be completed . it will continue to grow as long as there is imagination left in the world .
INFP	the tree which moves some to tears of joy is in the eyes of others only a green thing that stands in the way . some see nature all ridicule and deformity ... and some scarce see nature at all . but to the eyes of the man of imagination , nature is imagination itself .
ENFP	there are many ways to be free . one of them is to transcend reality by imagination , as i try to do .
ESFP	the only limit to your impact is your imagination and commitment .

ESTP	a certificate of live birth is not the same thing by any stretch of the imagination as a birth certificate .
INTJ	here is everything which can lay hold of the eye , ear and imagination - everything which can charm and bewitch the simple and ignorant . i wonder how luther ever broke the spell .
INTJ	my country has contrived for me the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived .
INFP	the world of reality has its limits the world of imagination is boundless .
ESTP	for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself , which is always far more daring than any effort of the imagination .
ESTP	the imagination is the spur of delights ... all depends upon it , it is the mainspring of everything now , is it not by means of the imagination one knows joy ? is it not of the imagination that the sharpest pleasures arise ?
ESFP	we are living in a time when the world has suddenly discovered india because it s run out of raw material for its imagination . the raw materials for imagination are inexhaustible here .
INFP	don quixote s misfortune is not his imagination , but sancho panza .
INFJ	censorship is never over for those who have experienced it . it is a brand on the imagination that affects the individual who has suffered it , forever .
ESTP	where there is no imagination there is no horror .
ESFP	the public has an appetite for anything about imagination - anything that is as far away from reality as is creatively possible .
INFJ	uttering a word is like striking a note on the keyboard of the imagination .
ESTP	never lose sight of the fact that all human felicity lies in man s imagination , and that he can not think to attain it unless he heeds all his caprices . the most fortunate of persons is he who has the most means to satisfy his vagaries .
ENTP	but if i have a lot of imagination , i could tell myself whatever i wanted , you know . i handle myself quite well . i am kind of fascist with myself , you know . there s no discussion . there is an order . you follow it .
ESTP	truth titillates the imagination far less than fiction .
ISFP	i love theatrics and have a huge imagination : why would i want to sit onstage and sing a bunch of ballads back-to-back ?
ESFP	i have done a lot of bad things . use your imagination .
ESTP	it s a slight stretch of the imagination but most people are alike in most ways so i have never had any trouble identifying with the character that i am playing .
INTP	this is one of those cases in which the imagination is baffled by the facts .
ENTP	a great wind is blowing , and that gives you either imagination or a headache .
ISTP	i do not want to discredit people s individuality , but i think people are pretty much the same . people are very similar . if you have a good enough imagination then you can feel things that you personally have never done before . that s acting .
ISFP	my parents thought it was nice to develop my imagination , but they never seriously thought that anything would ever come of it . they said that i could not be an actress because i would be taller than all my leading men , so i thought i would be a writer instead .
ESTP	i believe in imagination . i did kramer vs. kramer before i had children . but the mother i would be was already inside me .
ENTJ	our democracy , our constitutional framework is really a kind of software for harnessing the creativity and political imagination for all of our people . the american democratic system was an early political version of napster .
ESFJ	ghost stories really scare me . i have such a big imagination that after i watch a horror movie like the grudge  , i look in the corners of my room for the next two days .
ISTP	essentially , i am untrained , so i just go with my imagination and try to put myself as solidly as i can into the shoes of whatever person i am going to be playing .
INTP	novelists are not equipped to make a movie , in my opinion . they make their own movie when they write : they are casting , they are dressing the scene , they are working out where the energy of the scene is coming from and they are also relying tremendously on the creative imagination of the reader .
INFP	i am a light sleeper . i have never been one of those people who can put their head down and suddenly everything disappears . nighttime is the time i get most scared , anxious or worried . in those darker moments before waking or sleeping is when i feel most , i do not know , i can turn on myself , and my imagination can take me dark places .
INFP	i have got quite a vivid imagination and i am easily overwhelmed by sensations and things that are beautiful or scary . i do not think i have ever seen a ghost - i think i am probably haunted by my own ghosts than real ones .
ESTJ	i am not a passive person by any stretch of the imagination .
ENFP	i feel very giddy with the idea of making my imagination take form and being able to put on a show where people leave feeling like they have experienced something .

ENFP	charles laughton , who s a great hero of mine , only ever made one film and it happens to be one of the great films ever , which is the night of the hunter .  it s full of his kind of imagination and creation and how you do things and just in the way he used the studio , i just thought it was a fantastical way of using the studio .

ENFJ	learning how to be still , to really be still and let life happen - that stillness becomes a radiance .

ENTP	i used to make up stuff in my bio all the time , that i used to be a professional ice-skater and stuff like that . i found it so inspirational . why not make myself cooler than i am ?
INTP	the difference between stupidity and genius is that genius has its limits .

ESTP	i am not the smartest fellow in the world , but i can sure pick smart colleagues .
INFP	the surest sign that intelligent life exists elsewhere in the universe is that it has never tried to contact us .
ISTP	i am an optimist in the sense that i believe humans are noble and honorable , and some of them are really smart . i have a very optimistic view of individuals .
INFP	we have now sunk to a depth at which restatement of the obvious is the first duty of intelligent men .
ESTJ	your intellect may be confused , but your emotions will never lie to you .

INTJ	i not only use all the brains that i have , but all that i can borrow .

ESTP	continuous effort - not strength or intelligence - is the key to unlocking our potential .
INFP	science has not yet taught us if madness is or is not the sublimity of the intelligence .
ESFP	i do not think the intelligence reports are all that hot . some days i get more out of the new york times .
ENTP	the first method for estimating the intelligence of a ruler is to look at the men he has around him .
ISTP	bottom line is , i did not return to apple to make a fortune . i have been very lucky in my life and already have one . when i was 25 , my net worth was $ 100 million or so . i decided then that i was not going to let it ruin my life . there s no way you could ever spend it all , and i do not view wealth as something that validates my intelligence .
ESFP	everything in the universe has a purpose . indeed , the invisible intelligence that flows through everything in a purposeful fashion is also flowing through you .
INFP	the modern mind is in complete disarray . knowledge has stretched itself to the point where neither the world nor our intelligence can find any foot-hold . it is a fact that we are suffering from nihilism .
ESTP	i do not even call it violence when it s in self defense i call it intelligence .
INTP	immaturity is the incapacity to use one s intelligence without the guidance of another .
ENTP	where the stakes are the highest , in the war on terror , we can not possibly succeed without extraordinary international cooperation . effective international police actions require the highest degree of intelligence sharing , planning and collaborative enforcement .
ISTJ	if men can develop weapons that are so terrifying as to make the thought of global war include almost a sentence for suicide , you would think that man s intelligence and his comprehension ... would include also his ability to find a peaceful solution .

ENTP	so far as i can remember , there is not one word in the gospels in praise of intelligence .
INTJ	it is not clear that intelligence has any long-term survival value .
ESTJ	in the aftermath of september 11 , and as the 9/11 commission report so aptly demonstrates , it is clear that our intelligence system is not working the way that it should .
ISFP	i am in awe of the universe , but i do not necessarily believe there s an intelligence or agent behind it . i do have a passion for the visual in religious rituals , though , even though they may be completely empty and bereft of substance . the incense is powerful and provocative , whether buddhist or catholic .
INFP	there can be no two opinions as to what a highbrow is . he is the man or woman of thoroughbred intelligence who rides his mind at a gallop across country in pursuit of an idea .
ENTJ	george w. bush attended the intelligence briefing every day . obama has not even attended half of them . he sends surrogates . that to me is significant .
INFJ	philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language .
ENTP	the clinton white house today said they would start to give national security and intelligence briefings to george bush . i do not know how well this is working out . today after the first one bush said , i have got one question : what color is the red phone ? 
ENFP	intelligence agencies keep things secret because they often violate the rule of law or of good behavior .
INTP	it s part of a writer s profession , as it s part of a spy s profession , to prey on the community to which he s attached , to take away information - often in secret - and to translate that into intelligence for his masters , whether it s his readership or his spy masters . and i think that both professions are perhaps rather lonely .
ESFP	bill gates wants people to think he s edison , when he s really rockefeller . referring to gates as the smartest man in america is not right ... wealth is not the same thing as intelligence .

INFP	if i could have been a marine biologist i would have , but i did not have that kind of intelligence . numbers were never my strong point .
INTP	the secret intelligence service i knew occupied dusky suites of little rooms opposite st james s park tube station in london .

ENFJ	when i went on to write my next book , working with emotional intelligence , i wanted to make a business case that the best performers were those people strong in these skills .

ESFJ	a great many people think that polysyllables are a sign of intelligence .
INFJ	i do not know how to depict intelligence .

ISTJ	it will be found an unjust and unwise jealousy to deprive a man of his natural liberty upon the supposition he may abuse it .
ENFP	never underestimate the power of jealousy and the power of envy to destroy . never underestimate that .
INFJ	i am drawn to women who are independent and creative , which is problematic because it s a struggle , a competition of careers . there s jealousy .
INFJ	those who are believed to be most abject and humble are usually most ambitious and envious .
INFP	serious sport has nothing to do with fair play . it is bound up with hatred , jealousy , boastfulness , disregard of all rules and sadistic pleasure in witnessing violence . in other words , it is war minus the shooting .
INTP	knowledge of what is does not open the door directly to what should be .
INFJ	he who knows nothing is closer to the truth than he whose mind is filled with falsehoods and errors .
INFJ	i was bold in the pursuit of knowledge , never fearing to follow truth and reason to whatever results they led , and bearding every authority which stood in their way .

ENFP	the possession of knowledge does not kill the sense of wonder and mystery . there is always more mystery .
INTJ	let us tenderly and kindly cherish , therefore , the means of knowledge . let us dare to read , think , speak , and write .
INTP	all our knowledge begins with the senses , proceeds then to the understanding , and ends with reason . there is nothing higher than reason .
INTJ	if knowledge can create problems , it is not through ignorance that we can solve them .
INTJ	suppose that we are wise enough to learn and know - and yet not wise enough to control our learning and knowledge , so that we use it to destroy ourselves ? even if that is so , knowledge remains better than ignorance .
INFP	the true method of knowledge is experiment .
INTP	reading furnishes the mind only with materials of knowledge it is thinking that makes what we read ours .
INTP	i had therefore to remove knowledge , in order to make room for belief .
ENTP	our knowledge can only be finite , while our ignorance must necessarily be infinite .
INFJ	consider your origins : you were not made to live as brutes , but to follow virtue and knowledge .
ESTP	depend upon it there comes a time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before . it is of the highest importance , therefore , not to have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones .
INTJ	i am hungry for knowledge . the whole thing is to learn every day , to get brighter and brighter . that s what this world is about . you look at someone like gandhi , and he glowed . martin luther king glowed . muhammad ali glows . i think that s from being bright all the time , and trying to be brighter .
INTP	whoever undertakes to set himself up as a judge of truth and knowledge is shipwrecked by the laughter of the gods .

ENTJ	all men by nature desire knowledge .
ENTJ	the one exclusive sign of thorough knowledge is the power of teaching .
INTJ	the saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom .
INTJ	our treasure lies in the beehive of our knowledge . we are perpetually on the way thither , being by nature winged insects and honey gatherers of the mind .
INTP	ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge : it is those who know little , and not those who know much , who so positively assert that this or that problem will never be solved by science .
ENTP	three passions , simple but overwhelmingly strong , have governed my life : the longing for love , the search for knowledge , and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind .

ENFP	thought must be divided against itself before it can come to any knowledge of itself .
INTP	universities exist to transmit knowledge and understanding of ideas and values to students not to provide entertainment for spectators or employment for athletes .
INFP	a civilization is a heritage of beliefs , customs , and knowledge slowly accumulated in the course of centuries , elements difficult at times to justify by logic , but justifying themselves as paths when they lead somewhere , since they open up for man his inner distance .
INTP	science is organized knowledge . wisdom is organized life .
ENTP	the degree of one s emotions varies inversely with one s knowledge of the facts .
INTJ	scientists have become the bearers of the torch of discovery in our quest for knowledge .
INFP	although modesty is natural to man , it is not natural to children . modesty only begins with the knowledge of evil .

ESFP	my mom took me to see carnal knowledge and the wild bunch and all these kind of movies when i was a kid .
INFP	take from the philosopher the pleasure of being heard and his desire for knowledge ceases .
INFP	we are sinful not only because we have eaten of the tree of knowledge , but also because we have not yet eaten of the tree of life . the state in which we are is sinful , irrespective of guilt .
INFP	how pathetically scanty my self-knowledge is compared with , say , my knowledge of my room . there is no such thing as observation of the inner world , as there is of the outer world .
ISFJ	when we go to the bible we should keep in mind that the basic principles of the bible are taught by god , but written down by human beings deprived of modern day knowledge . so there is some fallibility in the writings of the bible . but the basic principles are applicable to my life and i do not find any conflict among them .

ESTP	i love sleep . my life has the tendency to fall apart when i am awake , you know ?
INFP	there is a tide in the affairs of men , which taken at the flood , leads on to fortune . omitted , all the voyage of their life is bound in shallows and in miseries . on such a full sea are we now afloat . and we must take the current when it serves , or lose our ventures .

ENFJ	love is union with somebody , or something , outside oneself , under the condition of retaining the separateness and integrity of one s own self .
INFP	in our minds , love and lust are really separated . it s hard to find someone that can be kind and you can trust enough to leave your kids with , and is not afraid to throw her man up against the wall and lick him from head to toe .
ESTP	i am getting a wrinkle above my eyebrow because i just ca not stop lifting it , and i love that you know .
INFP	i usually get myself into situations that cause sparks . i mean i am a girl that likes the storms . i love feeling alive , i love walking out in the cold in my bare feet and feeling the ice on my toes .
ENFJ	there is hardly any activity , any enterprise , which is started out with such tremendous hopes and expectations , and yet which fails so regularly , as love .
ENFP	the impulse to cruelty is , in many people , almost as violent as the impulse to sexual love - almost as violent and much more mischievous .
ESTP	they are right to think that about me , because i am the person most likely to sleep with my female fans , i genuinely love other women . and i think they know that .
ENFJ	love is often nothing but a favorable exchange between two people who get the most of what they can expect , considering their value on the personality market .
INFJ	when you are taught to love everyone , to love your enemies , then what value does that place on love ?
ESTP	i am deeply grateful to the citizens of sarajevo and the sarajevo canton assembly for bestowing upon me this incredible honor of citizenship . i am so proud to now be a part of such an extraordinary part of the world and fellow citizen to the people i deeply love and admire .
ESTJ	at the end of the day , you know , love does not happen between two perfect people as much as we would wish .
ENFP	how can a woman be expected to be happy with a man who insists on treating her as if she were a perfectly normal human being .
INTP	marriage is neither heaven nor hell , it is simply purgatory .
ESTP	i have learned that only two things are necessary to keep one s wife happy . first , let her think she s having her own way . and second , let her have it .
ENFP	there is nothing in the world like the devotion of a married woman . it is a thing no married man knows anything about .
ENTJ	sometimes i wonder if men and women really suit each other . perhaps they should live next door and just visit now and then .
ISFP	if i get married , i want to be very married .
ENTP	keep your eyes wide open before marriage , half shut afterwards .
ENTJ	if you want to sacrifice the admiration of many men for the criticism of one , go ahead , get married .

ISTP	there s only one way to have a happy marriage and as soon as i learn what it is i will get married again .
INFP	there is nothing nobler or more admirable than when two people who see eye to eye keep house as man and wife , confounding their enemies and delighting their friends .
ENTJ	marriage is a series of desperate arguments people feel passionately about .
ENFJ	i think women are natural caretakers . they take care of everybody . they take care of their husbands and their kids and their dogs , and do not spend a lot of time just getting back and taking time out .
ISFP	there were three of us in this marriage , so it was a bit crowded .
ENFP	wit is the sudden marriage of ideas which before their union were not perceived to have any relation .
ENFP	how marriage ruins a man ! it is as demoralizing as cigarettes , and far more expensive .
ENTP	i believe marriage is between a man and a woman . i am not in favor of gay marriage . but when you start playing around with constitutions , just to prohibit somebody who cares about another person , it just seems to me that s not what america s about . usually , our constitutions expand liberties , they do not contract them .
ENFP	so many people prefer to live in drama because it s comfortable . it s like someone staying in a bad marriage or relationship - it s actually easier to stay because they know what to expect every day , versus leaving and not knowing what to expect .
ISFP	marriage destroyed my relationship with two wonderful men .
ISFJ	i feel very deeply about the need to respect and tolerate people of different social - or sexual orientation . but at the same time , i believe marriage should be preserved as an institution for one man and one woman .
ENTP	i opposed the defense of marriage act in 1996 . it should be repealed and i will vote for its repeal on the senate floor . i will also oppose any proposal to amend the u.s. constitution to ban gays and lesbians from marrying .
ISTP	having federal officials , whether judges , bureaucrats , or congressmen , impose a new definition of marriage on the people is an act of social engineering profoundly hostile to liberty .
ENTP	what i believe is that marriage is between a man and a woman , but what i also believe is that we have an obligation to make sure that gays and lesbians have the rights of citizenship that afford them visitations to hospitals , that allow them to be , to transfer property between partners , to make certain that they are not discriminated on the job .
INTJ	i think that gay marriage should be between a man and a woman .
ISFJ	my decision to end my marriage was such a risk to lose ratings and lose my fan base . i had to take that risk for my inner peace and to be happy with myself .
ENTP	divorce is probably of nearly the same date as marriage . i believe , however , that marriage is some weeks the more ancient .
ISFJ	my view is that marriage is a relationship between a man and a woman . that s the position i have had for some time , and i do not intend to make any adjustments at this point ... or ever , by the way .
ENTP	i think there are a whole host of things that are civil rights , and then there are other things - such as traditional marriage - that , i think , express a community s concern and regard for a particular institution .
ENTP	i do not think marriage is a civil right , but i think that being able to transfer property is a civil right .
ENTP	marriage is for women the commonest mode of livelihood , and the total amount of undesired sex endured by women is probably greater in marriage than in prostitution .
ISFJ	culture , what you believe , what you value , how you live matters . now , as fundamental as these principles are , they may become topics of democratic debates from time to time , so it is today with the enduring institution of marriage . marriage is a relationship between a man and a woman .
ESTJ	well i think in a marriage you have to be honest and ask yourself , you know , what is my role ? what is my responsibility ?
ESTJ	i have not supported same-sex marriage . i have supported civil partnerships and contractual relationships .
ESTJ	every marriage is a mystery to me , even the one i am in . so i am no expert on it .
ESFJ	i respect the fact that many denominations have different points of view with respect to gay marriage and they can hold that in the sanctity in the place of their religion and not bless them or solemnize them .
ENTP	whenever the people are for gay marriage or medical marijuana or assisted suicide , suddenly the will of the people  goes out the window .
INTP	it is always incomprehensible to a man that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage .
ISFP	i think like any marriage , especially when you have had divorced parents like myself you want to try even harder to make it work .
INFJ	marriage changes everything .
ENFP	i would love to have the same rights as everybody else . i would love , i do not care if it s called marriage . i do not care if it s called , you know , domestic partnership . i do not care what it s called .
ESTP	our nation must defend the sanctity of marriage .
ENFP	marriage is like a game of chess except the board is flowing water , the pieces are made of smoke and no move you make will have any effect on the outcome .
ISFP	gay marriage is going to happen . it must .
ESTP	i believe a marriage is between a man and a woman .
ISFP	sometimes i bust out and do things so permanent . like tattoos and marriage .

ISFP	i have always been suspicious of tv , i have always found music and video to be an unhappy marriage .
ESFP	after about 20 years of marriage , i am finally starting to scratch the surface of what women want . and i think the answer lies somewhere between conversation and chocolate .
INFP	a key to keeping your husband is getting him to miss you . that keeps a marriage fresh .
INFP	woman , or more precisely put , perhaps , marriage , is the representative of life with which you are meant to come to terms .
INFP	i think even in a good marriage , especially if you stay together long enough , there are going to be events that happen .
ESFP	the press is just not your friend when it comes to a marriage . that s why we did not sell the pictures of our wedding , and we got offered millions of dollars for them , millions .
ESFJ	i will always be sad that my marriage ended .
ESTP	i never had a policy about marriage . i got married very young in life and i always think in all relationships , i have always thought that it s counterproductive to have a theory on that .
ENFJ	marriage is this grand madness , and i think if people knew that , they would perhaps take it more seriously .
ISFP	after a while in marriage , it does not work anymore . there is something missing , there is something wrong . there are few marriages that stay alive forever . we like something , and after a while , we hate what we used to love .
ISTJ	i am not convinced about marriage . divorce is so easy , and that fact that gay people are not allowed to marry takes much of the meaning out of it . committing yourself to one person is sacred .
ESFJ	i thought the divorce statistics would never apply to me . i was beyond heartbroken when they did . but i got up and got on with it . i also kept my belief in marriage .
ISFJ	a marriage does not have to be perfect , but you can be perfect for each other .
INFJ	marriage is a risk i think it s a great and glorious risk , as long as you embark on the adventure in the same spirit .
ENTP	i did not think marriage worked . i thought everybody who was married was secretly miserable - that it was something they just put up with for their children .
ENFP	now i am a wife and a mother of two . it s a really different role . i always referred to no doubt as a marriage , because that s what it s like to be together for so long and go through what we have been through . i ca not really have that relationship with them anymore .
ENFP	a miracle ... my biggest accomplishment is my marriage so far . because it s hard , everyone knows it s hard .
ENTJ	i believe in traditional marriage .
ENTJ	well , marriage is a very important part of our culture and our society . if we want to have a hopeful and decent society , we ought to aim for the ideal .
ESTP	marriage has not been my thing . but gay people , knock yourselves out !
ESFJ	i do not have this fantasy about marriage anymore . everyone says it takes hard work . well , it kind of does - and i am much more pragmatic about romance than i used to be .
ESFJ	the rule with marriage is the less you talk about it the better , as far as i can tell .
ESFJ	while 45 of the 50 states have either a state constitutional amendment or a statute that preserves the current definition of marriage , left-wing activist judges and officials at the local levels have struck down state laws protecting marriage .
ESFJ	and that is why marriage and family law has emphasized the importance of marriage as the foundation of family , addressing the needs of children in the most positive way .
ESTJ	when david arquette and i got engaged we started therapy together . i d heard that the first year of marriage is the hardest , so we decided to work through all that stuff early .
ESTJ	is marriage for ever ? i think you get married with the intention that it will be , but who knows ?
ESTJ	it s so easy to grow apart marriage takes work .
ISTP	the truth is you can have a great marriage , but there are still no guarantees .
ESFP	and in a marriage you ca not try and be married . you are married or you are not married ... as far as i am concerned .
ESFJ	i am always told that what i say is controversial . why is it controversial ? because i speak from a tradition that has now fallen out of favor with the dominant media in this country . and so when i say things like marriage should be between one man and one woman , i am called a bigot .
ESTJ	any sex outside of the marriage bond between a man and a woman is violating god s law .
ESFP	i was very influenced by the musicals and romantic comedies of the 1930s . i admired gene harlow and such , which probably explains why , since the end of my marriage , i have dated nothing but a succession of blondes .
ENFP	i also think it was important for me and freddie to be able to have a lot of time to share our lives at the beginning of our marriage rather than my coming home at 9 or 10 at night from the set . things have really worked out for the best for both of us .
INFJ	ultimately , i believe the only secret to a happy marriage is choosing the right person . life is a series of choices , right ?
ESFJ	is not that the ultimate homeland security , standing up and defending marriage ?
ESFJ	every society in the history of man has upheld the institution of marriage as a bond between a man and a woman . why ? because society is based on one thing : that society is based on the future of the society . and that s what ? children . monogamous relationships .
ESTJ	i went nearly 30 years without being able to really seriously entertain marriage or a family . in fact , the word marriage  would actually give me a shake when it was brought up .
ENTP	i think gay marriage should be the national law .
ENTP	they make spy kids , they make scream , they make a scary movie . this does not do that , so it could be a very bad marriage . i am trying to keep this potential nightmare quiet because we are just finishing editing .
ESTP	well i do not know that i am okay any more than anyone else is okay , i lead a happy life and a very full one - i have a happy marriage and my kids are all cheerful , and no one is finding fault with me , personally .
ENTJ	doctors will have more lives to answer for in the next world than even we generals .
INTJ	all sorts of computer errors are now turning up . you d be surprised to know the number of doctors who claim they are treating pregnant men .
INFP	i was always shocked when i went to the doctor s office and they did my x-ray and did not find that i had eight more ribs than i should have or that my blood was the color green .
ENFP	the christian s bible is a drug store . its contents remain the same , but the medical practice changes .
ENTP	if you are so pro-life , do me a favour : do not lock arms and block medical clinics . if you are so pro-life , lock arms and block cemeteries .
ENTJ	what s important at the grocery store is just as important in engines or medical systems . if the customer is not satisfied , if the stuff is getting stale , if the shelf is not right , or if the offerings are not right , it s the same thing . you manage it like a small organization . you do not get hung up on zeros .
ESFJ	information on how to heal autism and how to possibly delay vaccines or prevent autism should not come from me . it should come from the medical establishment .

INTP	nearly all men can stand adversity , but if you want to test a man s character , give him power .
INFP	all the world s a stage , and all the men and women merely players : they have their exits and their entrances and one man in his time plays many parts , his acts being seven ages .
ENFJ	rarely do we find men who willingly engage in hard , solid thinking . there is an almost universal quest for easy answers and half-baked solutions . nothing pains some people more than having to think .

ESFP	do not pray for easy lives . pray to be stronger men .

ENFJ	we have guided missiles and misguided men .
INTP	force always attracts men of low morality .
INTP	to sin by silence when they should protest makes cowards of men .
ESTP	there is no hunting like the hunting of man , and those who have hunted armed men long enough and liked it , never care for anything else thereafter .
ESFP	within the covers of the bible are the answers for all the problems men face .
INTP	our defense is in the preservation of the spirit which prizes liberty as a heritage of all men , in all lands , everywhere . destroy this spirit and you have planted the seeds of despotism around your own doors .

ESFP	you have to spend a lot to make a lot . it s not like i am sitting on top of a pile of money .
INTJ	as kids we did not complain about being poor we talked about how rich we were going to be and made moves to get the lifestyle we aspired to by any means we could . and as soon as we had a little money , we were eager to show it .
ISFP	my body ca not put anyone in jeopardy of not making money anymore - my body is just not on the table that way anymore .
ENFP	i have no idea how much money i have got .
INFP	you are right on the money with that . we are all like detectives in life . there s something at the end of the trail that we are all looking for .
ESFJ	i like my money right where i can see it ... hanging in my closet .
ESFP	hollywood is so fake and people need to realize that people are just people , and you , too , do not need to be born into something or have money or have whatever product someone is hawking on you .
ESTJ	i think that lawyers are terrible at admitting that they are wrong . and not just admitting it also realizing it . most lawyers are very successful , and they think that because they are making money and people think well of them , they must be doing everything right .
ENTP	i think that money spoils most things , once it becomes the primary motivating force .
ESTP	expensive clothes are a waste of money .
ENTJ	hussein has chosen to spend his money on building weapons of mass destruction and palaces for his cronies .
ESFP	ridiculous yachts and private planes and big limousines wo not make people enjoy life more , and it sends out terrible messages to the people who work for them . it would be so much better if that money was spent in africa - and it s about getting a balance .
ESFP	i grew up in a really small town with not a lot of money , and i liked singing , but it was just something that was a hobby .
ESTP	you can get rich making fun of me . i know . i have made lots of money making fun of me .
INFJ	money makes your life easier . if you are lucky to have it , you are lucky .
ESFJ	i have a lot of money stashed away , but i do live my life from day to day .
ESFP	first and foremost i am a drummer . after that , i am other things ... but i did not play drums to make money .
ESTP	financially , i have lost money and made money , but i know my way around financially .
ENFJ	selling out is doing something you do not really want to do for money . that s what selling out is .
ENTJ	i actually think that the economy has got some positives . it s got the market . it s got consumer confidence and it s got banks throwing - i mean central bankers throwing money at it around the world .
ESTJ	let s be honest , i have enough money to never have to work again .
ISTJ	if anyone tells you it s impossible to be fabulous and smart and make a ton of money using math , well , they can just get in line behind you - and kiss your math .
INFP	money is not important , but you have to have enough , so you do not have to think about it . thinking about money is a drag .
ENTP	money is everywhere but so is poetry . what we lack are the poets .
ENFJ	my recollection is - and i d have to confirm this - but i do not recall paying any money to go to law school .
ESFJ	i used to get my money at the end of the week , buy my mum something , or buy a record , and that was it .
ESFJ	i have no one to leave the money to . i am a single man . i like spending my money .
INFJ	prayer is the key of the morning and the bolt of the evening .
ENTP	i wake up every morning at nine and grab for the morning paper . then i look at the obituary page . if my name is not on it , i get up .
INTJ	the sun is new each day .
INFP	think in the morning . act in the noon . eat in the evening . sleep in the night .
ESFJ	it ai not as bad as you think . it will look better in the morning .
ESFJ	i remind myself every morning : nothing i say this day will teach me anything . so if i am going to learn , i must do it by listening .
ESTP	i may be drunk , miss , but in the morning i will be sober and you will still be ugly .
ISFJ	and this president wakes up every morning , looks out across america and is proud to announce , it could be worse .  it could be worse ? is that what it means to be an american ? it could be worse ? of course not . what defines us as americans is our unwavering conviction that we know it must be better .
ENTJ	just in terms of allocation of time resources , religion is not very efficient . there s a lot more i could be doing on a sunday morning .
ENFP	a leaf fluttered in through the window this morning , as if supported by the rays of the sun , a bird settled on the fire escape , joy in the task of coffee , joy accompanied me as i walked .
ENFP	the person who does not scatter the morning dew will not comb gray hairs .
ESTP	to be intimate with a married man , when my own father cheated on my mother , is not something i could forgive . i could not look at myself in the morning if i did that . i would not be attracted to a man who would cheat on his wife .
ENFJ	i have retired , but if there s anything that would kill me it is to wake up in the morning not knowing what to do .
ESFP	i always do an all-night horror marathon on saturdays where we start at seven and go until five in the morning .
ISFP	you wake up in the morning and you look at your old spoon , and you say to yourself , mick , it s time to get yourself a new spoon .  and you do .
ESFP	i , of course , meditate for two hours every morning . it s part of my schedule i wake up at 4 a.m. every day and i love it .
ENFP	what inspires you , what excites you when you wake up in the morning ?
ISFP	when i wake up in the morning , i feel just like any other insecure 24-year-old girl .
ISFP	i still , at hotel rooms , i do this one sort of not-so-cool thing : continually shoving my room service tray in front of someone else s door . because i do not want the remnants . i do not want to be caught , like , being like the pig that i was at two in the morning .
ISFJ	i have just finished my 20th book this past year and i am working on my 21st book about the middle east right now that i will finish this year . and i get up early in the morning and when i get tired of the computer and tired of doing research , i walk 20 steps out to my woodshop and i either build furniture or paint paintings . i am an artist too .
ESFP	i am very happy with the way i look . i wake up some morning , catch myself in the bathroom mirror , and go , hey girl , you are alright  . but on the other hand , i find the website stuff , and the polls , something completely removed from my own personal life . you ca not take anything like that too seriously , otherwise you d end up in the loony bin .
ENTP	one morning , just like 9/11 , there s going to be a disaster . i have yet to see the united nations do anything effective with either iran or north korea .
ENTJ	most of the time i spend when i get up in the morning is trying to figure out what is going to happen .
ISFP	making love in the morning got me through morning sickness . i found i could be happy and throw up at the same time .
ENTP	i am not an employee who goes to the office every morning at the same time . then , vacations are needed .
ENFJ	it did not matter what you look like . you do not have to get up at 5:30 in the morning and there s a lot to be said for that . corpse bride can just play all my parts from now on and i will just do the voice .
ENFJ	it s a privilege to serve the poor , to be servants of noble africans , but i better belong in the rehearsal room or in the studio with my band . that s where i want to be and i still wake up in the morning with melodies in my head .
ESTP	let me tell you , it is still morning in america . it just happens to be kind of a head pounding , hung over for four hours in america - and it s shaping up to be a nasty day , but its still morning in america .
ESTP	i was in washington , d.c. , on the morning show , by the time i was 18 , programming a station by 19 , no . 1 in the mornings . i think i was making , i do not know , a quarter of a million dollars by the time i was 25 .
ENTP	i hear that 5 o'clock whistle in my mind like fred flintstone and i have to stop . i am also not much of a morning writer . i have a sweet spot from about 11am to 4pm . but i really work during that time .
ISTP	i like being in movies that have a great story . i am not so interested in being a hollywood star . it s a job , you know . when you wake up at six in the morning every day for a week , it feels like hard work .
ESFJ	when i travel , i like to take advantage of room service . i am really into eggs benedict in the morning .
ESTP	but when i felt like i had something to prove ? then i got up early every morning and worked all day long . i did not know if i had any more talent than anyone else directing , but i knew i could work hard at it , and so i did .
ENFP	nowadays , everybody assumes , when they wake up in the morning , if they have a question , it will get answered . because they have the internet . no matter what the question is , someone will answer their question .
INFJ	it s never really that much fun for me to do movies anyway , because you - you know , you have to get up very early in the morning and you have to go in and you spend a lot of time waiting around .
ENTJ	i mean , if you have to wake up in the morning to be validated by the editorial page of the new york times , you got a pretty sorry existence .
ISTP	what is news ? it s hard to quantify . certainly news has changed completely , and the morning shows are not really designed to bring you the news , except to tell you what happened overnight , and the rest of it is a kind of magazine mentality - a little bit of this , a little bit of that . it s harder to be an educated and informed citizen .
INTJ	my days , if they start in the morning with a cuddle from my son , are just so much more glorious than they were prior to that .
ESFP	sometimes i wake up in the morning and i am like , this is a high-top day  or this is a bob day ,  but when i get my clothes on that s when i see .
ESFP	when i get up in the morning and put on a pink or a green wig , i see myself as a piece of animation . it lets me be the person i want to be , a person who s not embarrassed to have fun .
ISFJ	i wake up laughing . yes , i wake up in the morning and there i am just laughing my head off .
INFJ	london is completely unpredictable when it comes to weather . you will start a scene , and it s a beautiful morning . you get there at 6 in the morning , set up , you start the scene , start shooting . three hours later , it is pitch black and rainy .
ESFJ	i have to say that when you tour the world , obviously , the jetlags and different hours and ways of living and traveling , a lot of hours in the plane , and you wake up in the morning and you are not quite sure where you are , and it is very tiring .
INTP	if you are changing the world , you are working on important things . you are excited to get up in the morning .
ENFP	the episodes all blend together for me , so i do not remember . i ca not even remember what i had for breakfast this morning . i always feel i must be such a disappointment to them .
ISFP	every time i get up in the morning , melodies occur to me and i start trying to shape lyrics to melodies .
ENFP	i could announce one morning that the world was going to blow up in three hours and people would be calling in about my hair !
ENFP	but , you know , they do not enjoy the dinner hour together . it s just not as much of a ritual at night and it s interesting . i think the ritual is taking place perhaps more in the morning .
ENFP	but of course when people watch morning television , terry , it s a very different animal . you know , they are running around , they are getting their kids ready for school , they are probably doing eight million things , they are brushing their teeth .
ENFP	all three networks have always had a morning show but now cable of course is taking some of that audience away and a variety of other things , probably the internet as well .
ESFJ	i wake up every morning and i feel like i am juggling glass balls . i live in los angeles , my business is run out of london , and most evenings i am cuddled up in front of skype , in my dressing gown , speaking with my studio in london . i travel a lot , my team travel a lot , but i would not have it any other way .
ESFJ	i made it a morning show . we have the coffee cup , we have the morning papers . it s got that feel to it , that s what i wanted .
ESFJ	i have done the best i can with the morning show . i made it a morning show . we have the coffee cup , you have the morning papers , you know , it s got that feel to it , that s what i wanted .
ESFJ	it means a lot in my business and its a wonderful feeling to be recognized for what you have done over a lifetime , but i did not go crazy . i still eat my cereal in the morning , have a sandwich in the afternoon , go to bed at night . you know , nothing really different .
ENTP	i was up watching meet joe black at four am . i was hoping brad pitt would die , and he was still alive at seven forty in the morning ! i actually felt sorry for once , for critics .
INFJ	sometimes it s so weird just to do an interview . this morning i was back in my parents  house , with my brother , and we went for a jog together , then had breakfast as a family . and a couple of hours later i am wearing high heels and a dress and makeup , and talking about my job .
ENFJ	i like everything perfect . everything has to be neat . my sister is 5 , and she s more messy than i am . i make my bed every morning , everything s perfect . my shoes are all arranged . it s sad . i am a little like ray , a little bit .
INTJ	a creative man is motivated by the desire to achieve , not by the desire to beat others .
ESTP	if you are going through hell , keep going .
ESFP	be miserable . or motivate yourself . whatever has to be done , it s always your choice .
ENFP	if you can dream it , you can do it .
INFJ	do you want to know who you are ? do not ask . act ! action will delineate and define you .
ENTP	by failing to prepare , you are preparing to fail .
INTP	you have to learn the rules of the game . and then you have to play better than anyone else .
INFJ	determine never to be idle . no person will have occasion to complain of the want of time who never loses any . it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing .
ESFP	things do not happen . things are made to happen .
ENFP	the secret of getting ahead is getting started .
ENTP	well done is better than well said .
ENTJ	quality is not an act , it is a habit .
ESFP	setting goals is the first step in turning the invisible into the visible .
ESTJ	you ca not build a reputation on what you are going to do .
INFP	to know oneself , one should assert oneself .
ESTP	you need to overcome the tug of people against you as you reach for high goals .
INFJ	do not weep do not wax indignant . understand .
INFP	film spectators are quiet vampires .
INFP	am i a romantic ? i have seen wuthering heights  ten times . i am a romantic .
ENFP	movies can and do have tremendous influence in shaping young lives in the realm of entertainment towards the ideals and objectives of normal adulthood .
ESTP	the length of a film should be directly related to the endurance of the human bladder .
ISTP	a film is - or should be - more like music than like fiction . it should be a progression of moods and feelings . the theme , what s behind the emotion , the meaning , all that comes later .
ISTP	if my films do not show a profit , i know i am doing something right .
ISFP	everything makes me nervous - except making films .
INFP	it s the movies that have really been running things in america ever since they were invented . they show you what to do , how to do it , when to do it , how to feel about it , and how to look how you feel about it .
ESTP	a good film is when the price of the dinner , the theatre admission and the babysitter were worth it .
ISFP	so , where s the cannes film festival being held this year ?
ESTP	a lot of movies are about life , mine are like a slice of cake .
INFP	movies are like an expensive form of therapy for me .
ESTJ	every great film should seem new every time you see it .
ENTP	even if i set out to make a film about a fillet of sole , it would be about me .
ENFP	everyone told me to pass on speed because it was a bus movie . 
ESTJ	most of us do not consciously look at movies .
ENFP	there s an electrical thing about movies .
ESFP	my skin is hard when it comes to my music . but with my movies , i am still a virgin in a lot of ways . i am not used to being shot down for no reason .
ESFP	i think with movies i am really connecting to the joseph campbell idea of the collective unconscious .
INFP	over the years all these vampire movies have come out and nobody looks like a vampire anymore .
INTJ	one of my movies was called true lies .  it s what the democrats should have called their convention .
INTJ	i was striving to be the most muscular man , and it got me into the movies . it got me everything that i have .
ESFP	to me , movies and music go hand in hand . when i am writing a script , one of the first things i do is find the music i am going to play for the opening sequence .
ESTJ	by going to the movies , and because of other things , too , going to college , making a wide variety of friends , moving around traveling , i became a lot more open-minded than the heritage i was born into might have suggested .
ESFP	i wanted to do another movie that could make us laugh and cry and feel good about the world . i wanted to do something else that could make us smile . this is a time when we need to smile more and hollywood movies are supposed to do that for people in difficult times .
ESFP	movies are not about the weekend that they are released , and in the grand scheme of things , that s probably the most unimportant time of a film s life .
ESFP	i am not a hollywood basher because enough good movies come out of the hollywood system every year to justify its existence , without any apologies .
ESFP	movies are my religion and god is my patron . i am lucky enough to be in the position where i do not make movies to pay for my pool . when i make a movie , i want it to be everything to me like i would die for it .
ESFP	if you just love movies enough , you can make a good one .
ESFP	all my movies are achingly personal .
ESFP	i have loved movies as the number one thing in my life so long that i ca not ever remember a time when i did not .
ESFP	i just grew up watching a lot of movies . i am attracted to this genre and that genre , this type of story , and that type of story . as i watch movies i make some version of it in my head that is not quite what i am seeing - taking the things i like and mixing them with stuff i have never seen before .
ESFP	i do not really have a schedule of when i want to show my children my movies .
ISTP	sexiness , particularly in movies , is the chess game in the thomas crown affair  . it s , it s , i do not know , but faye dunaway comes up a lot in that thinking . it s the subtlety of sexiness . the moment you try to be sexy , then it s not .
ENFP	i have been pregnant in so many movies it s ridiculous .
ENFP	there are a lot of movies that are unbelievable successes that i would be mortified to be a part of .
ENTP	i can be in 20 movies . but i will never be an actor .
INFP	sex is a doorway to something so powerful and mystical , but movies usually depict it in a completely flat way .
ENFJ	not only do i have to live , right , i have to get some cash for my troubles - it s a scary thing , and people need to start to think about the messages that they send in the movies .
ESFP	everyone related to me in my circle was from church : church friends , church school , church activities . all my friends were not allowed to watch mtv or go to pg-13 movies or listen to the radio , so i did not really know anything different . that s how i was raised .
ESFJ	i am doing les miserables ,  the movie . i have done a lot of musicals and a lot of movies , and i know there are not a lot of people in hollywood who have been down those two paths so i have been like , come on , let s do a movie/musical . 
ESFJ	i have done many movies that people had not seen . the fountain ,  i spent a year on that . the prestige  with chris nolan , and australia .  from my perspective it s very satisfying . some movies people see and other movies they do not . wolverine ,  x men ,  i know that in some level people know me just for that and it s fine for me .
INFP	i do not know what it was , maybe the movie theaters in my immediate surrounding neighbourhood in burbank , but i never saw what would be considered a movies .
INFP	i never really got nightmares from movies . in fact , i recall my father saying when i was three years old that i would be scared , but i never was .
ISTP	even the worst bond movies , there s something to love about them .
INFJ	i see a lot of movies . i love films as a spectator , and that s never obscured by the part of me that does the work myself . i just love going to the movies .
INTJ	my children have never watched any of my films . charlie knows that daddy makes movies , but he says they are not good enough for him to watch .
ESTP	i still like the run and gun action movies and how truly dangerous it can be to make these films .
ESTP	frankly , i got into the movies because i like the movies a lot .
ISTP	sure , twilight  is really huge right now and everybody s freaking out over it , but it will go away soon and i will be back to doing what i am used to doing : weird little movies that nobody sees .
ESTP	i have a very busy life , and not many people who have a career and four kids go out a lot to the movies .
ESTP	i think that s what distinguishes schmidt , really . in the movies now , so much of what is appealing to an audience is the dramatic or has to do with science fiction , and schmidt is simply human . there s no melodrama there s no device , it s just about a human being .
INFP	and what i like about it is it makes me happy and i think it makes a lot of people happy to go to the movies and to not think about the problems of the day or the problems of tomorrow or the yesterday and just go on for the ride and have the fun of losing oneself in a fantasy .
ESFP	i was not allowed to go to movies when i was kid my father was a minister . 101 dalmatians and king of kings , that was the extent of it .
ISTP	i do not want to make movies for kids , and i do not want to make movies for adults either .
ISFJ	well , everyone likes movies when they are a little kid .
ISTJ	i played winnie cooper on the wonder years  from ages 12-18 , and did a few other movies during some of the summers .
ISTJ	i used to love to go to the movies - i d see two in a row . a few times i even snuck into the second movie after it started ... now that i think about it , that s kind of like shoplifting ! needless to say , i still love going to the movies , but i do not sneak in anymore .
ENFJ	most of the time it s the role . sometimes it s the story and sometimes it just the paycheck . it s the little movies that come out as stories or the fact that i have work to go out , you know what i am saying , you can only be out so long without work , you start getting antsy .
ENFJ	it can have an enormous effect because big budget movies can have big budget perks , and small budget movies have no perks , but what is the driving force , of course , is the script , and your part in it .
ENFJ	people need to start to think about the messages that they send in the movies .
ENTP	i do not quote my own movies . i think i would be pretty insufferable if i did .
ENTP	people do not have these tidy little redemption arcs in reality the way they do in movies .
ENTP	i am not an especially highbrow person , but i have always loved small , quirky , edgy movies .
ENTP	i do not know why , but i have always been a sucker for roller coasters in movies .
ISTP	it s not like i sit around watching my movies again and again , but i have never quite believed actors when they say they do not watch themselves .
ESTP	the reason i chose the movies that i did was based on where they were being filmed .
ESFJ	i wanted to be in jim carrey comedy movies before i met him . i wanted to be a comedian on stage 19 , yukking it up .
ISTP	you are creating new things in movies and people are going to steal them .
ISTP	when you are making movies you have got to get obsessive .
ISTP	i guess you could say i have been in my share of violent movies .
ISTP	i was sick and tired of being an english actor who did a lot of american movies because i was cheap and good .
ISTP	i always wanted to make movies .
ISTP	if i wanted to make spy movies for the rest of my life , that would be one thing , but i do not want to just make spy movies .
ESFP	i am not a film buff . i do not watch a lot of movies .
ESFP	growing up i did not watch movies .
ISFP	i think we are very complicated and we are capable of all kinds of things , and movies do not reflect that .
ISFP	i think it s more interesting to see people who do not feel appropriately . i relate to that , because sometimes i do not feel anything at all for things i am supposed to , and other times i feel too much . it s not always like it is in the movies .
ESTJ	we can now have action movies with two stars where one might be african american and one might be asian american . one of them does not have to be white , and the other one does not have to be the ethnic sidekick . we are way over that . and i think it s happening in society , too .
ISFJ	i have made movies that we are very successful that we are a complete surprise , and i have made movies that i thought we are going to be very successful that , you know .
ISFJ	my favorite characters are the ones that are the most successful movies .
ISFJ	i have made three musical movies which is pretty good considering that not many are made but i was lucky in other ways . i came along when independent movies were starting to boom .
ISFJ	when videotape came so a lot of movies that i do have a kind of afterlife in video . things where movies that i do would come and go they still come and go but you can go rent them and see them on tv .
ISFJ	i think if you do something effectively whether you are the lover or the comic or the action guy or the villain like i play movies are very expensive to make . chances are you will get asked to play that part again .
ISFJ	i have been in movies that i thought i was not very good in .
ISFJ	i make movies that nobody will see . i have made movies that even i have never seen .
ISFJ	i used to be prettier than i am , but i think i look better now . i was a pretty boy . particularly in my early movies . i do not like looking at them so much . there s a sort of pretty thing about me .
ENTP	i aim for a lifetime full of movies .
ESTP	i do not know why i do not watch a lot of movies i can barely keep up with the things my friends are in . there is not enough time in life .
ISTP	and being as i am somebody who loves movies like the machinist , i also love going along to big mass entertainment movies . i get in the mood for all kinds of movies , and so i like to try each of them .
ISTP	in terms of the romantic kind of lead , i just never enjoy those movies very much . maybe they will come to interest me more as i get older . i doubt it , but maybe . romantic comedies tend to be , for me , an oxymoron .
ISTP	there are movies that require fantasy and slightly more fantastical acting . lines that are good for certain movies , in real life circumstances , would be absolutely unbelievable things to really say , and you would look at these people like they are freaks for conversing that way . but somehow for certain styles of movies , it works , and it seems fine .
ISTP	i like the idea of movies having a magic element . how many times have you seen an actor in a movie who you know only as the character ? it s wonderful , is not it ?
ISTP	i do not get it when you get so much openness about the way movies are made , and the special effects and the behind-the-scenes stuff and all of that . i ca not help but feel like this reduces it a little bit .
ISTP	i always leave that for other people to decide , because some of the things i consider to be disasters are some people s favorite movies . and that s what i like so much , is that you never know . something intrigues somebody and means nothing to somebody else .
ISTJ	where i live , nobody who s fourteen is having sex and doing major drugs . and i think if you see it in the movies , you may be influenced by it . i think it s so important to preserve your innocence .
ISTJ	there are movies where we are interested in seeing people s lives without agreeing with what they are doing .
ESFJ	i have turned down twentysomething million dollars for movies .
INFP	when i started to watch some of the films i d done , i realized i was doing movies that i might not actually want to see .
ENFP	i just think old old movies , they make you concentrate and pay attention so much more . they feel so warm . a lot of modern digital videotape , it s just too bright . do not know why , it s not warm .
ISFP	sundance is weird . the movies are weird - you actually have to think about them when you watch them .
INFP	i want to make all kinds of movies . i do want to make big movies that are a lot of fun to go to , but i also want to make movies that are going to stimulate some thought and maybe raise some awareness .
INFP	i do like to move and get physical in my movies .
INFP	i am an enormous admirer of christopher lee . he s somebody , along with vincent price , who i celebrate , and i wanted my movies to show that celebration and that honoring of these great film stars that were unafraid to go into horror and grand guignol and the macabre .
INFP	i have eclectic tastes in the movies i want to do .
INFP	i do not want to just do independent movies and i do not want to just do adventure films . i enjoy both , and i think both are cogent .
INFP	i am the first to admit that i like going to , or my memories at least of going to clint eastwood movies or charles bronson or james bond .
INFP	i like fantasy . i like horror , science fiction because i can get avant-garde with those performances in those movies .
INFP	i care about the connection with the audience . film is such a powerful medium . movies can change the way people think .
INFP	i do enjoy animated movies .
ESFP	you do not want to be photographed ? you do not want to be known ? then you do not need to be out there peddling movies .
ESFP	i have not deliberately set out to play the blonde bombshell in my movies . in fact , it s probably been quite the opposite . after the success of the mask , i was not offered all that many blonde bombshell parts , to be honest . i think people believed from the beginning that i could actually walk and talk at the same time .
INTJ	i want to make movies that pierce people s hearts and touch them in some way , even if it s just for the night while they are in the cinema in that moment , i want to bring actual tears to their eyes and goosebumps to their skin .
INFJ	people wrestle sometimes making movies , and i think that conflict is a very essential thing . i think a lot of very happy productions have produced a lot of very banal movies .
INFJ	i like making movies for myself and my friends and people with my sensibility .
INFJ	i just love movies .
INFP	there s this index that tallies up how much your movies have made , and if they have not grossed a certain amount , then you are not bankable . i know i am not will smith but , you know , my ranking s pretty low . the only studio picture i have done is zodiac ,  and that did not perform that well .
INFP	i could not survive just doing independent movies . and i d rather do modelling than movies or tv i did not like .
ESFP	i did not know what types of movies i wanted to do . i want to do things that are different . i want to take my time with each role .
ESFP	i just want to keep doing what i am doing and hopefully people will watch my movies .
ESFP	i grew up when i was 15 when i had my first opportunity in movies . i watched every great movie for a year and a half , and since then i have asked myself how i can emulate such artistry . that s really my motivation . i want to do something as good as my heroes have done .
ENFP	i loved old black and white movies , especially the fred astaire and ginger rogers musicals . i loved everything about them - the songs , the music , the romance and the spectacle . they were real class and i knew that i wanted to be in that world .
ESTJ	a lot of people just go to movies that feed into their preexisting and not so noble needs and desires : they just go to action pictures , and things like that .
ESTJ	class is often invisible in america in the movies , and usually not the subject of the film .
ESTJ	movies absorb our attention more completely , i think .
ESTJ	the movies that are made more thoughtfully or made or with more ambition often get just get drowned out by the noise .
ENTJ	i was watching up in the air  and i thought , jesus , who s the old gray-haired guy ?  and it was me . i never wear makeup for movies and now it s starting to show .
ESFJ	my passion is doing movies , and as long as i keep doing that , i will be happy . i want to do movies , fun roles and dramatic ones . i love all of it .
ESFJ	my passion is doing movies , so as long as i keep doing that i will be happy .
ISTJ	i am fed up with the idiots ... the ever-widening gap between people who know how to make movies and the people who green-light the movies .
ENTJ	i grew up on bette davis movies , and marlene dietrich , marilyn monroe .
ISFJ	you have to get the audience invested even if you are doing something that they think is dumb , it s kind of what these movies are all about .
ISFJ	if you really want to be competitive in today s market you have to be in movies that make money .
ISFJ	and you also have to do movies that are about commerce because that s what is required of the industry today .
INFP	usually when you see females in movies , they feel like they have these metallic structures around them , they are caged in by male energy .
ISTP	i think what a lot of action movies lose these days , especially the ones that deal with fantasy , is you stop caring at some point because you have lost human scale .
ISTP	with the cgi , suddenly there s a thousand enemies instead of six - the army goes off into the horizon . you do not need that . the audience loses its relationship with the threat on the screen . that s something that s consistently happening and it makes these movies like video games and that s a soulless enterprise . it s all kinetics without emotion .
ESTP	yes , i am going to be the president of the united states . you know why ? you think you can get chicks by being in the movies ? you can really get chicks by being the president .
ESTP	i kinda see my current position like this : here s your five minutes in the toy store , so you got ta do all the good movies you can before chuck woolery  rings the bell .
ESTP	the one benefit of having done all kinds of movies as an actor is , you learn the pros and cons of being tempted to do a really big movie because it costs a lot of money .
ESTP	you are basically the sum of all the experiences you have ever had , and they are sort of shaken up in you and reproduced in the things you create , and that includes seeing movies .
ESTP	not that it entirely matters : there is a perception that all actors make their movies . a lot of people assume you are responsible . george clooney told me actors get all of the blame and all the credit .
ESTP	my movies are unadorned , they are not particularly fancy , i think they are kind of workmanlike in some ways , focusing on the writing and the acting .
ESTP	i knew i had to get out of boston and stop making movies there , at least for one movie , otherwise no one would ever consider me for a movie that took place south of providence .
ESTP	i have never held myself up particularly high when i had movies that worked , and i never held myself all that low when i had failures .
ESFJ	i always , always meant to be on stage . i only ended up even auditioning for television and movies because i was understudying a turgenev play on broadway and was so broke that , when i got a mini-series , i had to take it and was so ashamed because i was such a snob .
ISFP	i was influenced when i was younger by the cartoon movies that disney put out , like cinderella and what not . i watched those movies over and over when i was younger and the music is ingrained into my head . nowadays , i am still humming the tunes . it taught me the fundamentals .
ISFP	i like simple things . i like to sneak in the theatre and watch movies . i am a movie buff .
ISFP	if i did any movies i d have to take a break from singing , because i d want it to be really good .
ENFJ	i could not be happier about being a part of hunger games  and to play katniss . i have a huge responsibility to the fans of this incredible book and i do not take it lightly . i will give everything i have to these movies and to this role to make it worthy of suzanne collins  masterpiece .
ENFJ	i never think it s right to chew gum in front of other people , but a lot of times i will come in for a meeting chewing gum and i will forget i am chewing it . then you do not want to swallow it because it stays in your system for seven years or something , so i have asked to throw it away . i have started to wonder if that s why i did not get certain movies .
ENFP	i do believe that movies are subject to a million interpretations .
ENFP	i loved the movies and i wanted to be like marilyn monroe . i thought she was so glamorous and everyone seemed to love her . i wanted to be like that and i told everyone i would be the next marilyn monroe .
INFJ	i like movies that are about real people in real time with real problems .
INFJ	i learned a lesson which i did not heed : do not put yourself in your movies . it s too much .
INFJ	i went through this very serious woody allen phase in college and a little bit after college . i still see his movies .
INFJ	i actually have a thing about proper nouns . they clang on my ear in a weird way when i hear them dropped into movies .
INFJ	when i go to movies and i love the movie , it s because it feels like it articulated something about how we are living now , and also gives me some insight into my own life . i feel actually altered after having seen it .
INFJ	a lot of times , we are just sold these movies that are really cynically conceived and marketed , and they just want you there opening weekend , before everybody finds out it s not so good .
INTJ	i did not have any ambition to produce big mainstream popcorn movies .
ENFP	all through my life what i have loved doing is watching movies . i love the escapism of film , i love stories . so it is incredible to be able to be in them as much as i am , to see them from the first stitch in a costume to the end product .
ISTP	i filmed seven movies in 2011 and i think that was a mistake . i pushed myself too hard and i want to be able to come to work each day and give 100 percent . i guess i found out what my boundaries are .
ISTP	i am into the walking dead ,  shaun of the dead ,  obviously , and i have seen all the romero movies . i am a classic zombie queen . and i love the white walkers on game of thrones .  weirdly , it was not until pretty late in life that i found my entry point into horror films .
INFJ	for a number of years , i d been around the kind of people who financed movies and the kind of people who are there to make the deals for movies . but i d always had this naive idea that everybody wants to make movies as good as they can be , which is stupid .
ISTJ	i do not like to watch my own movies - i fall asleep in my own movies .
ISTJ	movies are hard work . the public does not see that . the critics do not see it . but they are a lot of work . a lot of work .
ISTJ	i will work with a director if i think i am going to get into a comfortable situation , and if it s someone i respect and who respects me , even if they are not so well known . movies are hard to make , and you have to work toward a common ethic and do your best .
ENFP	coming home had been made before and apocalypse now and deer hunter , different kinds of movies .
ENFP	i am terrible at horror movies , by the way . i get scared so easily .
ENFP	one of the joys of going to the movies was that it was trashy , and we should never lose that .
INTJ	i do not know if i see myself as really an action hero , but i like doing physical movies and i like doing movies where the writing is very lean .
INTJ	i love european movies and i kind of grew up on european films .
ISFJ	if i have to produce movies , direct movies , whatever to change the way hollywood treats older women , i will do it . if i have to bend the rules , i will . if i have to break them , i will .
INTJ	i have always had this idea that i wanted movies to make people better not worse .
INTJ	so , yes , there s nothing i love more than listening to directors talk about their movies .
INTJ	the movies i made when i was 14 or 15 , i have a hard time looking at those . those were the awkward years . i do not know if anybody can look at something they did when they were 14 and not wince .
ENFP	well , the thing about great fictional characters from literature , and the reason that they are constantly turned into characters in movies , is that they completely speak to what makes people human .
ENFP	i did not know this about myself , but when pirates of the caribbean  came out i realised that i did not enjoy a huge amount of recognition . i did not react to it well , but i think life is about finding out who you are and what you like . so i started doing independent movies and art-house films instead .
ESTJ	books and movies are different art forms with different rules . and because of that , they never translate exactly .
INFJ	i worked so hard for so long - i did a lot of movies . i also worked a lot when my kids were smaller , before they were in school .
INFJ	there s always an imbalance with actors and actresses in the industry . and i think because there are just fewer movies overall being made , it s that trickle down effect .
ENTP	when i finally got up to industrial light and magic to work on the star wars  movies as a model-maker , it felt like dying and going to heaven .
INTP	but when you are writing a script - for me anyway - you have to sort of create an enforced innocence . you have to divest yourself of worrying about a lot of stuff like what movies are hot , what movies are not hot , what the budget of this movie might be .
INTP	of course for many years directors have had to go on the road with their movies and promote them and i have done that since the beginning . so that s not new but the forms of it are different such as with the internet .
ISFP	whenever i think about movies , i always look at that art process as having the best of a lot of worlds . because if you watch a great film , you have a musical element to it , not just on the scoring , but in the way that the shots are edited - that has music and rhythm and time .
INTP	the more unique your film is and unusual it is and difficult it is , the harder it is to get it financed . that s why a lot of good filmmakers are doing television . they do hbo movies .
ENFP	my favorite movies are movies that i go in and i leave deeply affected . whether i laugh really hard or whether i cry really hard , i just want to feel really affected in that moment .
ENFP	i like to think of myself as a fairly educated human being , but i am a very uneducated actor when it comes to movies , directors , producers , actors for that matter .
ISTJ	i never wanted to do the same kind of movies over and over anyway , so my theory on it all is i am just gon na try and dodge the label and keep doing what i am doing .
ISTJ	success is not something i have wrapped my brain around . if people go to those movies , then yes , that s true , big-time success . if not , it s much ado about nothing .
ISTJ	if your movies do not perform , they just stop calling you .
ISTJ	that s the way this business works : if your movies do well at the box office , you will be offered more movies . it does not matter if you are a nice guy or you are a prick . if your movies do well , there s a job waiting for you in hollywood . it s not any more complicated than that .
ENFJ	when i am shooting a movie , i am always in an invisible theater seat . i respect the fact that people have worked hard all week and want to go to the movies on the weekend and be entertained .
ESFJ	it s hard to incorporate dance into movies i think .
ESFJ	i love the old fred astaire and gene kelly movies they are so beautiful to look at . it s such a shame we do not make them anymore . although , i do not know how you could make tap dancing current and topical .
INFP	i usually do get the tomboy parts in the movies , which is kind of like me , but not totally . i like to shop as much as ashley , but she is a little more of a girlie-girl than me .
INFP	blessed are the hearts that can bend they shall never be broken .
ENFJ	forget the past .
ISFP	i must be careful not to get trapped in the past . that s why i tend to forget my songs .
ISFP	music does not lie . if there is something to be changed in this world , then it can only happen through music .
ENFP	after silence , that which comes nearest to expressing the inexpressible is music .
INFP	music is everybody s possession . it s only publishers who think that people own it .
ISFP	music is my religion .
INTJ	in music the passions enjoy themselves .
ENTJ	i do not make music for eyes . i make music for ears .
ISTP	music , in performance , is a type of sculpture . the air in the performance is sculpted into something .
INFJ	music is the strongest form of magic .
INFP	where words fail , music speaks .
ENTP	the ipod completely changed the way people approach music .
INTP	he who joyfully marches to music in rank and file has already earned my contempt . he has been given a large brain by mistake , since for him the spinal cord would suffice .
ISFJ	the sexual embrace can only be compared with music and with prayer .
INFP	the man that hath no music in himself , nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds , is fit for treasons , stratagems and spoils .
INFP	music inflames temperament .
ISFP	sometimes i feel like rap music is almost the key to stopping racism .
ISFP	music is a safe kind of high .
ISFP	if people take anything from my music , it should be motivation to know that anything is possible as long as you keep working at it and do not back down .
ISFP	when i die , i want people to play my music , go wild and freak out and do anything they want to do .
ISFP	this land is your land and this land is my land , sure , but the world is run by those that never listen to music anyway .
ISFP	music is so therapeutic for me that if i ca not get it out , i start feeling bad about myself - a lot of self-loathing .
ISFP	i have accomplished enough with the music that i have not had to go out there and do other things to over-saturate .
ISTP	without music to decorate it , time is just a bunch of boring production deadlines or dates by which bills must be paid .
ISFP	i try to use my music to move these people to act .
ISFP	the reflection of the world is blues , that s where that part of the music is at . then you got this other kind of music that s tryin  to come around .
ISTP	it is piracy , not overt online music stores , which is our main competitor .
INTJ	my heart , which is so full to overflowing , has often been solaced and refreshed by music when sick and weary .
ISFP	music makes me high on stage , and that s the truth . it s like being almost addicted to music .
ISFP	people today are still living off the table scraps of the sixties . they are still being passed around - the music and the ideas .
ISFP	here s the thing with me and the religious thing . this is the flat-out truth : i find the religiosity and philosophy in the music . i do not find it anywhere else .
ISFP	i became interested in folk music because i had to make it somehow .
ISFP	folk music is a bunch of fat people .
ISFP	you ca not imagine parlor ballads drifting out of high-rise multi-towered buildings . that kind of music existed in a more timeless state of life .
ISFP	look , when i started out , mainstream culture was sinatra , perry como , andy williams , sound of music . there was no fitting into it then and of course , there s no fitting into it now .
ISFP	if you do not know the blues ... there s no point in picking up the guitar and playing rock and roll or any other form of popular music .
ISTP	most people would not know music if it came up and bit them on the ass .
ISTP	my mother knew how to read music and everything . but i just kinda learned off of records . and so , i was listening to records and i d play em over and over .
ENTJ	music is the voice that tells us that the human race is greater than it knows .
ENTJ	i like having my hair and face done , but i am not going to lose weight because someone tells me to . i make music to be a musician not to be on the cover of playboy .
ESFP	music for me , it demands full concentration .
INFP	poetry fettered , fetters the human race . nations are destroyed or flourish in proportion as their poetry , painting , and music are destroyed or flourish .
ISTP	music is always a commentary on society .
INTJ	i enjoy all forms of music - pop , classical and opera .
ISFP	i want my fans to love themselves . it s almost like i want to hypnotize them so when they hear my music they love themselves instantly .
ESFJ	music has healing power . it has the ability to take people out of themselves for a few hours .
ISFP	rock and roll : music for the neck downwards .
ISFP	on the other hand , what i like my music to do to me is awaken the ghosts inside of me . not the demons , you understand , but the ghosts .
ENFJ	when i was a teenager , i began to settle into school because i d discovered the extracurricular activities that interested me : music and theater .
ISFP	i came into music just because i wanted the bread . it s true . i looked around and this seemed like the only way i was going to get the kind of bread i wanted .
ISFP	nothing pleases me more than to go into a room and come out with a piece of music .
ENFP	i get bored easily , so i need to do a lot . i have started a record label , so i get to nurture new talent and talk about music , which is a passion of mine . i have written another book . and i get to come to work and do the tv show , which is always really fun .
ESFP	i am a big collector of vinyl - i have a record room in my house - and i have always had a huge soundtrack album collection . so what i do , as i am writing a movie , is go through all those songs , trying to find good songs for fights , or good pieces of music to layer into the film .
ISFP	i had to resign myself , many years ago , that i am not too articulate when it comes to explaining how i feel about things . but my music does it for me , it really does .
INFJ	i decided to make music again at a time when i could not have had more obstacles .
INFJ	what i know is my music gets blamed for school shootings .
ISFP	the only things mick and i disagree about is the band , the music and what we do .
ISFP	i felt i really wanted to back off from music completely and just work within the visual arts in some way . i started painting quite passionately at that time .
ISFP	i think what made it difficult for people to get , and still makes it difficult for people to get , is the theatrical nature of the work and the fact that , my music does not exist without the performance-art element .
ESTP	people have not always been there for me , but music always has .
ESFP	i think older people can appreciate my music because i really show my heart when i sing , and it s not corny . i think i can grow as an artist , and my fans will grow with me .
ISFP	it was elvis who really got me hooked on beat music . when i heard heartbreak hotel  i thought , this is it .
ISFP	music itself is going to become like running water or electricity . so it s like , just take advantage of these last few years because none of this is ever going to happen again . you d better be prepared for doing a lot of touring because that s really the only unique situation that s going to be left .
INFP	i think the most important thing about music is the sense of escape .
ISFP	i dropped out of nyu , moved out of my parent s house , got my own place , and survived on my own . i made music and worked my way from the bottom up .
ISFP	i wanted to prove the sustaining power of music .
ISFP	i do not profess to have music as my big wheel and there are a number of other things as important to me apart from music . theatre and mime , for instance .
ISFP	the absolute transformation of everything that we ever thought about music will take place within 10 years , and nothing is going to be able to stop it . i see absolutely no point in pretending that it s not going to happen . i am fully confident that copyright , for instance , will no longer exist in 10 years .
ESTP	i would love to continue in music , with writing ... but i am not the kind of person who will hang around if i start to become irrelevant . if that happens , i will bow down gracefully , raise my kids , and have a garden . and i am going to let my hair go gray when i am older . i do not need to be blonde when i am 60 !
ESTP	i think i first realized i wanted to be in country music and be an artist when i was 10 . and i started dragging my parents to festivals , and fairs , and karaoke contests , and i did that for about a year before i came to nashville for the first time . i was 11 and i had this demo cd of me singing dixie chicks and leanne rimes songs .
INFJ	i will give up this sort of touring madness certainly , but music-everything is based on music . no , i will never stop my music .
ISFP	pop music will never be low brow .
ISFP	unless i am both capable of and willing to reopen the wound every time i write a song , if i choose to not look inside myself to write music , i am really not worth being called an artist at all .
ISFP	i write music every day .
ISFP	i do not want to make niche-oriented music .
ISFP	i just want to keep writing music .
ISFP	you know , the bbc had not been particularly generous in its deliverance of blues and esoteric kinds of music .
ESTP	music is my shining light , my favorite thing in the world . t get me to stop doing it for one second would be difficult !
ESTP	for me , great music does not just have to fall into one category or one genre and i love appreciating all kinds of music .
ISFP	inspiration for my music just comes from , you know , my life experiences .
ENTP	music is a great energizer . it s a language everybody knows .
ESTP	i do not think i d ever make an album of just covers because i love writing my own music .
ISFP	you used to have to sing and convey emotion , and now , well , technically you can do anything with technology . it sucks for music today , but that s why that old music feels so good to me .
ESFJ	as a boy , i d always had an interest in theater . but the idea at my school was that drama and music were to round out the man . it was not what one did for a living . i got over that .
ENFP	i think one of my favorite things to do is just lock myself up in a small room and listen to music and watch films for a day . also i just like seeing my friends . we have pizza parties which means i get four friends round , we eat a pizza and we are really lazy and we play playstation .
ISFP	for me the visual is just as important as the music .
INFJ	music is the emotional life of most people .
ESFP	i do not care what people say about my relationship i do not care what they say about my boobs . people are buying my songs i have a sold-out tour . i am getting incredible feedback from my music .
ISFP	pop is actually my least favorite kind of music , because it lacks real depth .
INFP	i have had to keep exploring different ways of presenting the music so i do not repeat myself .
INFP	people listen to music the way they want to listen to music .
INFP	i do not see music as working .
INFP	my father was a minister and so rock music was banned in our house .
INFP	this was a time frame when dance music and clubs were having a real impact on culture , and it had an impact on me .
INFP	music is always a reflection of what s going on in the hearts and minds of the culture .
ENFP	i dabbled in things like howlin  wolf , cream and led zeppelin , but when i heard son house and robert johnson , it blew my mind . it was something i d been missing my whole life . that music made me discard everything else and just get down to the soul and honesty of the blues .
ESFJ	i love music .
ESFP	if you like my music , great , and if you do not , whatever . i am going to keep making it either way .
ESFP	oh , i will always be honest with my music . the records are black boxes for me . like if you want to know who i am , my views , my perspective , things i love , things i hate , my convictions , my anthems . i have never let people s opinions affect the way i write .
INFJ	we used to play music for fun . much more than now . now nobody picks up a guitar unless they are paid for it .
INFJ	it is so characteristic , that just when the mechanics of reproduction are so vastly improved , there are fewer and fewer people who know how the music should be played .
ENTP	what i like about music is the songs you can remember the lines of in a single second .
ENTP	music is part of the life of fashion , too .
ESFJ	the only reason that you do visual is solely for the visual . that s the only reason . it does not sell your music for you .
ESFJ	without a doubt , the best way to get to know me is through my music .
ESFJ	country music is still your grandpa s music , but it s also your daughter s music . it s getting bigger and better all the time and i am glad to be a part of it .
ESFJ	music is a great natural high and a great natural escape .
ESFJ	marilyn monroe never sold a platinum album . and more people know my music than what i look like .
ESFJ	my music must reflect whatever s going on in my mind , and my life needs to evolve for me to discover who it is i am becoming .
ENFJ	every so often , i feel i should graduate to classical music , properly . but the truth is , i am more likely to listen to rock music .
ISTP	for me , music and life are all about style .
INFP	maybe someday you can accuse somebody of being a poseur by selling out and playing blues music , but that s just not going to happen in my lifetime .
ENTJ	i have not heard any music on the bbc world service in a long time . maybe i am listening at the wrong times . but not one single piece of music .
ESTP	music is the language of the heart , and conservatives always screw it up .
ISTJ	my husband is a composer , so he plays piano all the time and i sit there and clap telling my unborn child , hear me clap , hear the music .  i know music , in general , is supposed to be good for babies to hear .
ENFJ	i think abba have a pure joy to their music and that s what makes them extraordinary .
ENFJ	the great moments of rock n  roll were never off in some corner of the music world , in a self-constructed ghetto .
ENFJ	rock music is niche .
INTJ	the basis of our partnership strategy and our partnership approach : we build the social technology . they provide the music .
ESFJ	soul music is timeless .
INFP	there s a constantly applicable nature to soul music , whereas sometimes pop music can be a periodical .
ISFJ	i have been composing music all my life and if i d been clever enough at school i would like to have gone to music college .
INTJ	that s why this generation is the least racist generation ever . you see it all the time . go to any club . people are intermingling , hanging out , having fun , enjoying the same music . hip-hop is not just in the bronx anymore . it s worldwide . everywhere you go , people are listening to hip-hop and partying together . hip-hop has done that .
ESTP	i do not listen to a lot of new stuff . i just like the old stuff . it s all quite dramatic and atmospheric . you d have an entire story in song . i never listen to , like , white music - i could not sing you a zeppelin or floyd song .
ESTP	i listen to music that is of our time and i just get angry .
ENTP	ah , reality tv : where opportunists delight in exposing opportunism ! it s kind of like the indie music scene .
INFP	hopefully people can see my music is tethered to my brain .
INFP	i am a good music provider , and i am fine with that . i am a quality music manufacturer .
INFP	i scientifically engineer my music to be as accessible as possible .
INFP	it s almost charity work , what people have done , turning other people on to my music .
INFP	the way i feel about music is that there is no right and wrong . only true and false .
INFP	i have never believed that pop music is escapist trash . there s always a darkness in it , even amidst great pop music .
INFP	also , because people like to multitask , in a way if you have got a bit of music on in the background and the lyrical content is making you want to listen to it , then that would probably put you off the texting you wanted to do . i think people like things that just make that right kind of noise , but leave your brain free to do something else .
ISFP	what s missing from pop music is danger .
ISFJ	music will always be my no . 1 passion , but i do not have to be doing it professionally . it s not really about that for me anymore . i feel like i do not have to look at it as a career . i can just rest in it and just be .
ISFJ	when you grow up in the music industry , trying to be britney spears because that s what sells records and then you realize , all i have to do is be myself ? i should have thought of that a long time ago ,  it feels good to have success come from what s actually inside of you .
INFP	hearing my songs in public freaks me out a bit . there was one restaurant i really liked in l.a. , but i had to stop going there when they started playing my music . it felt kinda awkward .
INFJ	one and the same thing can at the same time be good , bad , and indifferent , e.g. , music is good to the melancholy , bad to those who mourn , and neither good nor bad to the deaf .
ENFP	and the day came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom .
INTP	look deep into nature , and then you will understand everything better .
ESTP	one of the most tragic things i know about human nature is that all of us tend to put off living . we are all dreaming of some magical rose garden over the horizon instead of enjoying the roses that are blooming outside our windows today .
INFP	in the depth of winter i finally learned that there was in me an invincible summer .
ESTP	solitary trees , if they grow at all , grow strong .
INFP	one touch of nature makes the whole world kin .
INFP	autumn is a second spring when every leaf is a flower .
ENTJ	in all things of nature there is something of the marvelous .
ENTJ	if one way be better than another , that you may be sure is nature s way .
ENTJ	if you wish to make an apple pie from scratch , you must first invent the universe .
ENFP	spring is nature s way of saying , let s party ! 
INTJ	for in the true nature of things , if we rightly consider , every green tree is far more glorious than if it were made of gold and silver .
ISTP	i am two with nature .
INTP	to sit in the shade on a fine day and look upon verdure is the most perfect refreshment .
INTJ	nature is wont to hide herself .
INFJ	a strong body makes the mind strong . as to the species of exercises , i advise the gun . while this gives moderate exercise to the body , it gives boldness , enterprise and independence to the mind . games played with the ball , and others of that nature , are too violent for the body and stamp no character on the mind . let your gun therefore be your constant companion of your walks .
INTP	joy in looking and comprehending is nature s most beautiful gift .
INTP	we still do not know one thousandth of one percent of what nature has revealed to us .
INTP	occurrences in this domain are beyond the reach of exact prediction because of the variety of factors in operation , not because of any lack of order in nature .
INTP	it stands to the everlasting credit of science that by acting on the human mind it has overcome man s insecurity before himself and before nature .

ISTJ	time spent with cats is never wasted .
INFP	i wish i could write as mysterious as a cat .
ESFJ	the average dog is a nicer person than the average person .
ISTP	i poured spot remover on my dog . now he s gone .
ENFP	to his dog , every man is napoleon hence the constant popularity of dogs .
ISTJ	what counts is not necessarily the size of the dog in the fight - it s the size of the fight in the dog .
ENFP	do not sweat the petty things and do not pet the sweaty things .
ESTJ	a real christian is a person who can give his pet parrot to the town gossip .
ISFP	i got a pet monkey called charlie chan .
ISTP	my roommate got a pet elephant . then it got lost . it s in the apartment somewhere .
ISTJ	when a guy tells me i am cute , it s not something desirable . cute is more like what you want your pet to be .
ENFP	vinyl is the real deal . i have always felt like , until you buy the vinyl record , you do not really own the album . and it s not just me or a little pet thing or some kind of retro romantic thing from the past . it is still alive .
ESTJ	environmentalists hate sprawl - except when it comes to the size of their expansive pet legislation on capitol hill .
ISFJ	i have some road rage inside of me . traffic , especially in l.a. , is a pet peeve of mine .
ENFP	all bad poetry springs from genuine feeling .
ENFP	a poet can survive everything but a misprint .
ISTP	i was reading the dictionary . i thought it was a poem about everything .
ENTP	one merit of poetry few persons will deny : it says more and in fewer words than prose .
ENFP	a poet s work is to name the unnameable , to point at frauds , to take sides , start arguments , shape the world , and stop it going to sleep .
INFJ	poetry is just the evidence of life . if your life is burning well , poetry is just the ash .
INTP	pure mathematics is , in its way , the poetry of logical ideas .
ESFP	when power leads man toward arrogance , poetry reminds him of his limitations . when power narrows the area of man s concern , poetry reminds him of the richness and diversity of existence . when power corrupts , poetry cleanses .
INFP	listen , real poetry does not say anything it just ticks off the possibilities . opens all doors . you can walk through anyone that suits you .
INFP	if my poetry aims to achieve anything , it s to deliver people from the limited ways in which they see and feel .
ISFP	i read poetry to save time .
ISFP	i do not think i have ever read poetry , ever .
INFP	with me poetry has not been a purpose , but a passion .
ISFP	it s not easy to define poetry .
ENTP	the true spirit of delight , the exaltation , the sense of being more than man , which is the touchstone of the highest excellence , is to be found in mathematics as surely as poetry .
INFJ	when it comes to atoms , language can be used only as in poetry . the poet , too , is not nearly so concerned with describing facts as with creating images .
INTP	the bible should be taught , but emphatically not as reality . it is fiction , myth , poetry , anything but reality . as such it needs to be taught because it underlies so much of our literature and our culture .
INTP	i love romantic poetry .
ENFP	as an actor , there is room for a certain amount of creativity , but you are always ultimately going to be saying somebody else s words . i do not think i d have the stamina , skill or ability to write a novel , but i d love to write short stories and poetry , because those are my two passions .
INFJ	i never really liked poetry readings i liked to read poetry by myself , but i liked singing , chanting my lyrics to this jazz group .
INFJ	i always thought that poetry is the verdict that others give to a certain kind of writing . so to call yourself a poet is a kind of dangerous description . it s for others it s for others to use .
INFJ	i think the term poet is a very exalted term and should be applied to a man at the end of his work . when he looks back over the body of his work and he s written poetry then let the verdict be that he s a poet .
ESTP	i always wrote poetry and stuff like that , so putting songs together was not that spectacular .
INTJ	i think there are things in my story that have helped my creativity . your father being killed , for instance , is one of the best things that could happen to a kid if he s going to write poetry or songs .
ENFP	i wrote some bad poetry that i published in north african journals , but even as i withdrew into this reading , i also led the life of a kind of young hooligan .
ENTP	i wrote things for the school s newspaper , and - like all teenagers - i dabbled in poetry .
ISFP	i do not write poetry and then strum some chords and then fit the words on top of the chords .
ENFP	we are looking to brands for poetry and for spirituality , because we are not getting those things from our communities or from each other .
ENFP	suppose you were an idiot , and suppose you were a member of congress but i repeat myself .
INFJ	it is better to be violent , if there is violence in our hearts , than to put on the cloak of nonviolence to cover impotence .
ENTJ	i am extraordinarily patient , provided i get my own way in the end .
ESTP	if you have ten thousand regulations you destroy all respect for the law .
ESTP	healthy citizens are the greatest asset any country can have .
INFJ	whenever a man has cast a longing eye on offices , a rottenness begins in his conduct .
ENFP	principles have no real force except when one is well-fed .
ENFJ	if the united states of america or britain is having elections , they do not ask for observers from africa or from asia . but when we have elections , they want observers .
ENTP	politics have no relation to morals .
ENTJ	those who stand for nothing fall for anything .
ENTP	perseverance is the hard work you do after you get tired of doing the hard work you already did .

INFJ	the darkest places in hell are reserved for those who maintain their neutrality in times of moral crisis .
ESFJ	a leader in the democratic party is a boss , in the republican party he is a leader .
ISFJ	conservatism has had from its inception vigorously positive , intellectually rigorous agenda and thinking . that agenda should have in my three pillars : strengthen the economy , strengthen our security , and strengthen our families .
INTJ	in politics the middle way is none at all .
ESFJ	you want a friend in washington ? get a dog .
ENFJ	the successful revolutionary is a statesman , the unsuccessful one a criminal .
ENTP	conservatives are not necessarily stupid , but most stupid people are conservatives .
ESFJ	all the president is , is a glorified public relations man who spends his time flattering , kissing , and kicking people to get them to do what they are supposed to do anyway .
ENTJ	he who knows how to flatter also knows how to slander .
INTP	hell hath no fury like a bureaucrat scorned .
ISTJ	oh , that lovely title , ex-president .
INTJ	a conservative is a man who just sits and thinks , mostly sits .
INFJ	the secret of getting things done is to act !
INTJ	a conservative is someone who makes no changes and consults his grandmother when in doubt .
ENFP	turn on to politics , or politics will turn on you .
ENFP	i have been to war , and it s not easy to kill . it s bloody and messy and totally horrifying , and the consequences are serious .
INFJ	i never considered a difference of opinion in politics , in religion , in philosophy , as cause for withdrawing from a friend .
INTP	politics is for the present , but an equation is for eternity .
ESFP	it has been said that politics is the second oldest profession . i have learned that it bears a striking resemblance to the first .
INTP	i was losing interest in politics , when the repeal of the missouri compromise aroused me again . what i have done since then is pretty well known .
ESTP	politics is the ability to foretell what is going to happen tomorrow , next week , next month and next year . and to have the ability afterwards to explain why it did not happen .
ESTP	politics is almost as exciting as war , and quite as dangerous . in war you can only be killed once , but in politics many times .
ESTP	in war , you can only be killed once , but in politics , many times .
ESTP	i am never going to have anything more to do with politics or politicians . when this war is over i shall confine myself entirely to writing and painting .
ESTP	politics are very much like war . we may even have to use poison gas at times .
INFJ	those who say religion has nothing to do with politics do not know what religion is .
ESTP	in politics , nothing happens by accident . if it happens , you can bet it was planned that way .
ESFP	politics i supposed to be the second-oldest profession . i have come to realize that it bears a very close resemblance to the first .

ESTP	a typical vice of american politics is the avoidance of saying anything real on real issues .
ESFP	politics is like football if you see daylight , go through the hole .

ENTJ	in politics stupidity is not a handicap .
INTJ	i must study politics and war that my sons may have liberty to study mathematics and philosophy .
ESTP	the most practical kind of politics is the politics of decency .
ENFJ	before i went to jail , i was active in politics as a member of south africa s leading organization - and i was generally busy from 7 a.m. until midnight . i never had time to sit and think .
ENTP	there is probably a perverse pride in my administration ... that we were going to do the right thing , even if short-term it was unpopular . and i think anybody who s occupied this office has to remember that success is determined by an intersection in policy and politics and that you ca not be neglecting of marketing and p.r . and public opinion .
ENFP	the trouble with nixon is that he s a serious politics junkie . he s totally hooked and like any other junkie , he s a bummer to have around , especially as president .
ENTP	part of the reason that our politics seems so tough right now and facts and science and argument does not seem to be winning the day all the time is because we are hardwired not to always think clearly when we are scared . and the country s scared .
ENFP	the most shocking fact about war is that its victims and its instruments are individual human beings , and that these individual beings are condemned by the monstrous conventions of politics to murder or be murdered in quarrels not their own .
ENTJ	there are still people in my party who believe in consensus politics . i regard them as quislings , as traitors ... i mean it .

ISTP	politics is the entertainment branch of industry .
ISTP	i have not been very active in politics .
ESTJ	i think that you can disagree with people and debate over their positions with issues without engaging in the politics of personal destruction .
ENTJ	in politics , as in religion , it is equally absurd to aim at making proselytes by fire and sword . heresies in either can rarely be cured by persecution .
INTJ	i must not write a word to you about politics , because you are a woman .
ESTJ	in every country today , there is politics . it may be authoritarian politics , but there is politics .
ESTJ	i was in civil society long before i was ever in politics or my husband was ever even elected president .
INFP	if you have embraced a creed which appears to be free from the ordinary dirtiness of politics - a creed from which you yourself can not expect to draw any material advantage - surely that proves that you are in the right ?
INFP	what is a wife and what is a harlot ? what is a church and what is a theatre ? are they two and not one ? can they exist separate ? are not religion and politics the same thing ? brotherhood is religion . o demonstrations of reason dividing families in cruelty and pride !
ISTJ	when you are in any contest , you should work as if there were - to the very last minute - a chance to lose it . this is battle , this is politics , this is anything .
ISTJ	politics is a profession a serious , complicated and , in its true sense , a noble one .
ENTP	politics and the pulpit are terms that have little agreement .
INTJ	politics is a science . you can demonstrate that you are right and that others are wrong .
ESFJ	war should be the politics of last resort . and when we go to war , we should have a purpose that our people understand and support .

ESTP	if you are sick and tired of the politics of cynicism and polls and principles , come and join this campaign .
INTP	from politics , it was an easy step to silence .
INFJ	the advantage of the internet is that it has taken away the charade of politics . china has heard of democracy and people know about certain concepts they would not have previously .
ESTP	what we won when all of our people united must not be lost in suspicion and distrust and selfishness and politics . accordingly , i shall not seek , and i will not accept , the nomination of my party for another term as president .
ESTP	one lesson you better learn if you want to be in politics is that you never go out on a golf course and beat the president .
INTJ	politics i conceive to be nothing more than the science of the ordered progress of society along the lines of greatest usefulness and convenience to itself .
ESTP	i seldom think of politics more than eighteen hours a day .
ESTJ	i think that people are tired . they are tired of the same old kind of politics . people want a new tone to politics .
ISTP	first rule of politics : you ca not win unless you are on the ballot . second rule : if you run , you may lose . and , if you tie , you do not win .
ISTP	politics is human beings it s addition rather than subtraction .
ISTP	in politics , every day is filled with numerous opportunities for serious error . enjoy it .
INTJ	i do not think consensus-building politics is what i am meant to be doing .
INTJ	the advice i have been giving to people all my life - that you may not be interested in the dialectic but the dialectic is interested in you you ca not give up politics , it wo not give you up - was the advice i should have been taking myself .
INTJ	the term the american left  is as near to being meaningless or nonsensical as any term could really be in politics . it is not really a force in politics anymore . and it would do well to ask itself why that is .
ENFP	the democracy gap  in our politics and elections spells a deep sense of powerlessness by people who drop out , do not vote , or listlessly vote for the least worst  every four years and then wonder why after every cycle the least worst  gets worse .
ENTP	politics and war are remarkably similar situations .
ENFP	i do not know why that is , but english politics is just so overly white . it s very much about the class structure .
ENFJ	war is not the continuation of politics with different means , it is the greatest mass-crime perpetrated on the community of man .
ENFJ	you have got to watch the politics of aids . the politics of aids can work both for and against the victims of aids .
ESTP	the message that i gave on the - on the steps today was that you need to stand for those things that are right and empower the individual . believe in the power of one person . do not believe that you ca not do it . everybody wants - everybody wants a shot . that we can all agree on . beyond that , it becomes politics . i am not talking politics .
ESTP	i do not fancy myself a political commentator . i hate politics . i hate it .
ENFJ	you know , the media and politicians are always gon na be in a bit of tension with one another and probably most of the time that s healthy and indeed even creative . but it s where - it s really when news organisations are used as kind of instruments of politics that it gets tricky .
ESFJ	politics is not just a game of clashing parties and competing interests . the right reason is to challenge the status quo , to serve the common good , and to leave this nation better than we found it .
ENFJ	in no relationship at the top of any walk of life is it always easy , least of all in politics which matters so much and which is conducted in such a piercing spotlight .
ENFJ	i mean , i went to a church school when i was younger and imbibed a certain amount of religion then but it was really in university that i got interested in religion and politics at the same time . i do not think as if it were one moment of conversion but my spiritual journey really began then .
ESFJ	the lesson of the last year is this : foreign policy ca not be managed through the politics of personality , and our president would do well to take note of an observation john f. kennedy made once he was in office - that all of the world s problems are not his predecessor s fault .
ENTJ	frankly , if you do politics , you should not be thinking about your dignity .
ISFP	most people do not want to talk about politics and religion . they say , let s talk about something else . 
ENTJ	i was in elective politics for 24 years . i have made four national races , two for president , two for vice president . i have found there are other ways to serve , and i am enjoying them .
ENTJ	in general people feel more relaxed about participating in politics . they are not frightened as they used to be .
ENTJ	in politics , you also have to be cautiously optimistic .
ESTJ	i did not run for student council president . i do not see myself in any way in elected office . i love policy . i am not particularly fond of politics .
ESTJ	it s a good question , because a movie is not good or bad based on its politics . it s usually good or bad for other reasons , though you might agree or disagree with its politics .
ESTJ	well , you know what , i am 60 years old , and i have been interested in politics since i was on my daddy s knee . during the 1948 election , we were praying for truman . i know a lot about politics .
ENTJ	if i cry , it s about the personal loss of a friend or something like that . but when it comes to politics - no , i do not cry .
INFP	i do not know if anybody wants to mix their politics with their entertainment .
INTP	if there is one eternal truth of politics , it is that there are always a dozen good reasons for doing nothing .
ENTJ	if you really want to diminish a candidate , depict him as the foil of his handler . this is as old in american politics as politics itself .
ENTJ	look , there ought to be politics in politics .
ENTJ	the fallback position in politics is if you do not know what you want to be about , and if you do not know what your vision is , go at somebody else .
ENTJ	negative politics have always been around .
ENTJ	i will never get out of politics . i have friends in public office . i have things that i want to do . you ca not go back in life . i wo not go back to the existence i had before of running a political consulting firm and signing up clients and advising campaigns in exactly that way .
ENTJ	i know enough about european politics to know you have got a lot of crazy people who make their way onto the ballot .
INFP	i am not going to talk like i know about politics , because i am a total amateur , but maybe i can be a spokesperson for people who are not normally interested in politics .
INFP	but i am not interested in politics . i lose interest the microsecond it ceases to be emotional , when something becomes a political movement . what i am interested in is emotions .
ISFP	i do not get involved in record label politics .
ESTJ	the idea that religion and politics do not mix was invented by the devil to keep christians from running their own country .
ENTP	in politics a capable ruler must be guided by circumstances , conjectures and conjunctions .
ENTJ	i get asked a lot about getting into politics . i say , take a look at politics . you tell me what seems appealing about that . 
ISTJ	on the one hand , the financial projection is on the agenda - we will see if this problem can be resolved or not . i think it is a right idea to stage a special summit , which would deal with the question of priorities of european politics .
ISTJ	that is why everyone in politics , and we do it , must make sure that they do not depend on one single interest group . a good compromise is one where everybody makes a contribution .
ISTJ	thus , the focus on this main political goal must become more visible in eu politics and to achieve this , we need a political impulse . it must be clear what the priorities on the agenda are .
ISTJ	whoever decides to dedicate their life to politics knows that earning money is not the top priority .
ISTP	i have always hated celebrities lecturing people on politics . so forgive me . but i am passionate about this country . i am equally passionate about the potential of the people who live here .
ISFJ	i think the rules are going to have to change for me to ever run for public office . my checkered past will always keep me out of politics .
ENFP	acting is fun and i refuse to get involved in the semantics and the politics of strategy and breaking out of something or doing something because you need to do something else . for me it s all about what fuels my soul and if i am passionate about a screenplay then that s what i will do next .
ESFP	well , i think any time you delve into this sort of religion , politics , as you well know , you are going to , you know , touch a few nerves . i was not - now - and this is the honest truth .
ESFP	when you are enthusiastic about what you do , you feel this positive energy . it s very simple .
ISFJ	if you are given a chance to be a role model , i think you should always take it because you can influence a person s life in a positive light , and that s what i want to do . that s what it s all about .
ESFP	i am looking forward to influencing others in a positive way . my message is you can do anything if you just put your mind to it .
ENTP	and we can see the positive impacts right here at solyndra . less than a year ago , we were standing on what was an empty lot.but through the recovery act , this company received a loan to expand its operations . this new factory is the result of those loans .
ESTJ	there is a sense that things , if you keep positive and optimistic about what can be done , do work out .
ESFP	you ca not live a positive life with a negative mind and if you have a positive outcome you have a positive income and just to have more positivity and just to kind of laugh it off .
ISFJ	well , you know , a lot of people look at the negative things , the things that they did wrong and - which i do . but i like to stress on the things i did right , because there are certain things that i like to look at from a positive standpoint that are just positive reinforcement .
INFP	suffering is the positive element in this world , indeed it is the only link between this world and the positive .
ESFJ	i have been singing for six years . i have been in and out of the studios with top producers , but it was not something i was ready to express to the public or to the press . i was not ready to come out . i wanted to perfect my voice and be 100 percent positive that i could come out right .
ESFP	those minutes that i am on stage are the best ! being there and looking at the crowd and seeing their faces , hearing them sing the positive words from the songs .
ESTJ	people do not really understand , but having people stare , and point , and take pictures , even if it is in a positive framework , is quite isolating there s no two ways about it . you feel a little bit , you know , freakish .
ENTP	there s a weird cloud around you when you are recognizable . it was a brief window for me . i think you have to have a pathological need for attention of any type , negative or positive , to thrive in that kind of situation . and i only want compliments .
INFP	i do not like to read about myself , whether it be positive or negative .
INTP	i have always viewed the mission of wikipedia to be much bigger than just creating a killer website . we are doing that of course , and having a lot of fun doing it , but a big part of what motivates us is our larger mission to affect the world in a positive way .
ISFP	i am a positive person , and i try to look at the good side of everything .
ISFP	i would like to be a positive force for young girls .
INFJ	to be perfectly honest , i feel i have a duty to use my celebrity status in a positive way .
INFP	i think everyone goes through chapters in their life and there was a time when i was not feeling terribly positive about what i was contributing to film , or was not feeling as if i was going in the direction i wanted and i re-evaluated what i was doing .
ENFP	i would like to do something dark or small . i love independent films . i love emotional scenes . i love people who are struggling with something . i think it s just the juxtaposition to my incredibly happy , positive demeanor .
ISTJ	and what we have lost sight of is that performing manual labor with your hands is one of the most incredibly satisfying and positive things you can do .
ESFJ	i am a very driven , ambitious , positive person . but i am a spiritual person as well . i believe in creative visualization . so for me to go to america - which i find such a positive place - well , i took to it like a duck to water .
ENTJ	being powerful is like being a lady . if you have to tell people you are , you are not .
INTJ	all things are subject to interpretation whichever interpretation prevails at a given time is a function of power and not truth .
ISTP	the less effort , the faster and more powerful you will be .
ENTJ	what it lies in our power to do , it lies in our power not to do .
INTJ	every man builds his world in his own image . he has the power to choose , but no power to escape the necessity of choice .
INTJ	the world itself is the will to power - and nothing else ! and you yourself are the will to power - and nothing else !
INTJ	to achieve , you need thought . you have to know what you are doing and that s real power .
ENFJ	there is no meaning to life except the meaning man gives his life by the unfolding of his powers .
INFJ	power is given only to those who dare to lower themselves and pick it up . only one thing matters , one thing to be able to dare !
ENTP	the greater the power , the more dangerous the abuse .
ENFP	but to me nothing - the negative , the empty - is exceedingly powerful .
ESTP	it is folly for a man to pray to the gods for that which he has the power to obtain by himself .
INTJ	my relationship to power and authority is that i am all for it . people need somebody to watch over them . ninety-five percent of the people in the world need to be told what to do and how to behave .
ENTJ	the value systems of those with access to power and of those far removed from such access can not be the same . the viewpoint of the privileged is unlike that of the underprivileged .

INFJ	ambition is the immoderate desire for power .
ENTP	power without a nation s confidence is nothing .

INTP	the attempt to combine wisdom and power has only rarely been successful and then only for a short while .
INTP	the unleashed power of the atom has changed everything save our modes of thinking and we thus drift toward unparalleled catastrophe .
INFJ	the constitutions of most of our states assert that all power is inherent in the people that ... it is their right and duty to be at all times armed .
INFJ	our country is now taking so steady a course as to show by what road it will pass to destruction , to wit : by consolidation of power first , and then corruption , its necessary consequence .
ENTP	anyone who has the power to make you believe absurdities has the power to make you commit injustices .
ESTP	it is more agreeable to have the power to give than to receive .

INFP	words have no power to impress the mind without the exquisite horror of their reality .
ISFJ	you have power over your mind - not outside events . realize this , and you will find strength .
ISTP	respect your efforts , respect yourself . self-respect leads to self-discipline . when you have both firmly under your belt , that s real power .
ENFJ	passion is energy . feel the power that comes from focusing on what excites you .
ENTJ	in a democracy the poor will have more power than the rich , because there are more of them , and the will of the majority is supreme .
ESFP	all the waste in a year from a nuclear power plant can be stored under a desk .
ENTJ	a sense is what has the power of receiving into itself the sensible forms of things without the matter , in the way in which a piece of wax takes on the impress of a signet-ring without the iron or gold .
ESFP	now we have a problem in making our power credible , and vietnam is the place .
INTJ	i assess the power of a will by how much resistance , pain , torture it endures and knows how to turn to its advantage .
ENTJ	we have also arranged things so that almost no one understands science and technology . this is a prescription for disaster . we might get away with it for a while , but sooner or later this combustible mixture of ignorance and power is going to blow up in our faces .
INTJ	undeserved praise causes more pangs of conscience later than undeserved blame , but probably only for this reason , that our power of judgment are more completely exposed by being over praised than by being unjustly underestimated .

ISTJ	arbitrary power is most easily established on the ruins of liberty abused to licentiousness .
ISTJ	the constitution vests the power of declaring war in congress therefore no offensive expedition of importance can be undertaken until after they shall have deliberated upon the subject and authorized such a measure .
ISTP	this revolution , the information revoultion , is a revolution of free energy as well , but of another kind : free intellectual energy . it s very crude today , yet our macintosh computer takes less power than a 100-watt bulb to run it and it can save you hours a day . what will it be able to do ten or 20 years from now , or 50 years from now ?
INFP	all modern revolutions have ended in a reinforcement of the power of the state .
ENTJ	power is like being a lady ... if you have to tell people you are , you are not .
INFP	doublethink means the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one s mind simultaneously , and accepting both of them .
ENTP	here at this site , solyndra expects to make enough solar panels each year to generate 500 megawatts of electricity . and over the lifetime of this expanded facility , that could be like replacing as many as eight coal-fired power plants .
ISFP	i do not think i have ever been an agnostic . i have always thought there s a superior power , that this is not the real world and that there s a world to come .
ENTP	tonight , we gather to affirm the greatness of our nation - not because of the height of our skyscrapers , or the power of our military , or the size of our economy . our pride is based on a very simple premise , summed up in a declaration made over two hundred years ago .

ESTP	i believe in the transformational power of liberty . i believe that the free iraq is in this nation s interests . i believe a free afghanistan is in this nation s interest .

ENTJ	we are born to action and whatever is capable of suggesting and guiding action has power over us from the first .
ENTJ	militant feminists are pro-choice because it s their ultimate avenue of power over men . and believe me , to them it is a question of power . it is their attempt to impose their will on the rest of society , particularly on men .

ENTP	the law always limits every power it gives .
INTJ	when you give everyone a voice and give people power , the system usually ends up in a really good place . so , what we view our role as , is giving people that power .

ENFJ	it s easy to dislike the few senior women out there . what if women were half the positions in power ? it would be harder to dislike all of them .

ESTP	i could see myself in a relationship with a girl olivia wilde is so sexy she makes me want to strangle a mountain ox with my bare hands . she s mesmerizing .
INFP	if one could be friendly with women , what a pleasure - the relationship so secret and private compared with relations with men . why not write about it truthfully ?
ENFJ	but with christ , we have access in a one-to-one relationship , for , as in the old testament , it was more one of worship and awe , a vertical relationship . the new testament , on the other hand , we look across at a jesus who looks familiar , horizontal . the combination is what makes the cross .
ISFP	it s important to take time for your spouse and nurture the relationship .
ESTP	there is but one way for a president to deal with congress , and that is continuously , incessantly , and without interruption . if it is really going to work , the relationship has got to be almost incestuous .

INTJ	i am afraid the ss s relationship with the catholic church is something the church still has to deal with and does not deny .
INTP	until we have a better relationship between private performance and the public truth , as was demonstrated with watergate , we as the public are absolutely right to remain suspicious , contemptuous even , of the secrecy and the misinformation which is the digest of our news .
ENFJ	the test of one s behavior pattern is their relationship to society , relationship to work and relationship to sex .

INFP	when i play live , it s a conversation that we are all having with the song , and the audience ... their response and relationship with the songs is as valid as my relationship with the songs .
ESTP	when you think about it , we actors are kind of prostitutes . we get paid to feign attraction and love . other people are paying to watch us kissing someone , touching someone , doing things people in a normal monogamous relationship would never do with anyone who s not their partner . it s really kind of gross .

ENTP	i had a very , very difficult relationship with my mother , who was supremely self-centred . she was hilariously self-centred . she did not really take interest in anything that did not immediately affect her .
ESFJ	i know children regress after vaccination because it happened to my own son . why are not there any tests out there on the safety of how vaccines are administered in the real world , six at a time ? why have only two of the 36 shots our kids receive been looked at for their relationship to autism ?
ENTP	i think the fact that i am so well known to be gay makes it very difficult to have a convincing relationship with a woman on screen . it would not be at all difficult for me to kiss a woman - i will kiss a frog if you like .
ENFP	i think the most important thing in life is self-love , because if you do not have self-love , and respect for everything about your own body , your own soul , your own capsule , then how can you have an authentic relationship with anyone else ?
ESFJ	i have always believed in people s capacity for goodness . i still believe that people are good . what i am not so trusting about anymore is their relationship to their own goodness .
ESTJ	it is better to have a relationship with someone who cheats on you than with someone who does not flush the toilet .
ISFP	i think at some stage , i would love to have another child . i would love to settle into a relationship that was really important to me . i actually am not good at the balance at that .
ISFP	even as a child i had a strong relationship with yearning and desire . and loss . those things spoke to me .
ESFJ	but you know , i have a pretty good relationship with the press and the paparazzi . it s just when they step over the line that , you know , enough s enough .
ENTP	what works in a relationship of very public people is not making the relationship public - keeping it as personal as it can be . it s the only way it is real .
INFJ	look , you have got a generation of people coming along who are going to form their own new relationship with the idea of supporting the causes that they care about or changing the world . and these people are not going to do it the way our parents do it .
ENTP	there s a lot about the character . it does not always happen , but there are some characters you really create a relationship with , almost as if they were your friend . and you never get into their heads again or think like them .
ESFJ	in a relationship , when does the art of compromise become compromising ?
ENTJ	when they watch a movie and they know that you are in a relationship , you just kind of watch that constantly .
ESFJ	the thing that stood out above and beyond all the experiences was this relationship with the nine-month-old baby . on weekends , i d be thinking about going back to set on monday just to see the baby .
ESTJ	i think every relationship has a point where you stop and reevaluate . are you happy ? have you grown together or apart ? what do you share interests in ? i think that s a normal thing to do , but it s so much harder when it s done publicly .
ESFJ	i have a much better relationship with the press than i did , i think because i stood my ground .
INTP	but i think the real tension lies in the relationship between what you might call the pursuer and his quarry , whether it s the writer or the spy .
ENTJ	i am always open to a relationship , but i am not putting those feelers out there now .
ENTJ	i am a relationship girl . that s kind of just how i am made ... when you are in my life , it s actually very contained .
ISFP	i grew up very religious , and i do not have a great relationship with religion .
INFP	there s such an extreme feeling to be in love , especially in quite an emotionally destructive relationship , where you are both kind of really bad for each other , but you love each other so much . those extreme emotions , i think , can only be described with extreme imagery .
ISFP	it takes bravery to end a relationship .
ISFP	obviously , a long-distance relationship is hard . but , like anything worth having , you make it work .
INFP	you know when you get into that thing where people want to discuss the relationship ? i d rather discuss what was on telly , avoid the issue , discuss anything other than the relationship .
INFP	this thing with everyone knowing you , it s weird , because people have this one-sided relationship where they look at your picture and feel they know you more than someone they actually know . i do not really know myself that well .
INFP	i am not one of these guys who s constantly in a relationship , not at all .
ISFP	when a relationship does not work anymore , it s terrible to stay with someone that you do not love .
ESFJ	i have stepped more into my womanhood , i am a mother now , i am having a beautiful relationship as a wife and as a friend .
ENTJ	i d think , in a relationship , we should never have his kind of fight .  then , instead of figuring out how to make it work , i looked for a way to get out of it . the truth is , you should not be married if your that kind of person .
ISTP	i am certainly not the first person to be in a relationship with a younger man , but somehow i was plucked out as a bit of a poster girl .
ISTP	i have had a love-hate relationship with my body .
ENTP	i think she definitely has . i think , um , her and mulder s relationship has become more equal . and , i think she has become stronger and more independent over the seasons .
ENFP	it s impossible . you try to have any kind of relationship with your family , with a man , or with a friend , and you have to be on the phone and the internet the entire time .
ESTP	over the years , i have been trying to build a relationship with an audience . i have tried to maintain as much of a low profile as i could so that those characters would emerge and their relationship with audiences would be protected .
INTP	i also think the relationship i have with my audience is a lot more complex than what hitchcock seemed to want his to be - although i think he had more going on under the surface as well .
ISFJ	well i think if you really go out with someone for quite a long time you do get to know each other very , very well , you go through the good times , you go through the bad times . you know both personally , but also within a relationship as well .
ISFJ	i had never really dated . i have always been a relationship kind of person .
ENFJ	certain people in the united states are driving nails into this structure of our relationship , then cutting off the heads . so the soviets must use their teeth to pull them out .
ISFP	though i still have no semblance of a life outside of nine inch nails at the moment , i realize my goals have gone from getting a record deal or selling another record to being a better person , more well-rounded , having friends , having a relationship with somebody .
ESFJ	everyone has an opinion of who you are and what your relationship is about , things that you have done or did not do in your relationship - and it s just all crap , really . things that are written about it are all crap .
ENTJ	first of all , returning from motherhood , i was looking for something lighter , and i was not as much attracted to kate as i was to the relationship between the two people .
ENTJ	but it s much more exciting to make die hard . one of the reasons that i think that movie is so successful is it deals with those very important blue-collar relationship themes . but it s more visually beautiful to show things blowing up . it just gives you more on the screen .
ENTP	i do not remember any sibling rivalry growing up , because by the time i was really conscious , tom was going away to college . my relationship with him , which is a very close one , really developed in more recent years .
ISTP	i know the russian political elite has got used to the ukraine suffering from an inferiority complex , but i want this to disappear from our relationship .

INFJ	a religion that takes no account of practical affairs and does not help to solve them is no religion .
INFJ	it is in our lives and not our words that our religion must be read .
ENTJ	a tyrant must put on the appearance of uncommon devotion to religion . subjects are less apprehensive of illegal treatment from a ruler whom they consider god-fearing and pious . on the other hand , they do less easily move against him , believing that he has the gods on his side .
INFJ	difference of opinion is advantageous in religion . the several sects perform the office of a censor - over each other .
ENFP	every religion is true one way or another . it is true when understood metaphorically . but when it gets stuck in its own metaphors , interpreting them as facts , then you are in trouble .
INFJ	gentleness , self-sacrifice and generosity are the exclusive possession of no one race or religion .
INFJ	one s own religion is after all a matter between oneself and one s maker and no one else s .
INFJ	religion is a matter of the heart . no physical inconvenience can warrant abandonment of one s own religion .

ENFP	when we blindly adopt a religion , a political system , a literary dogma , we become automatons . we cease to grow .
INTJ	in christianity neither morality nor religion come into contact with reality at any point .
INTJ	religion is the impotence of the human mind to deal with occurrences it can not understand .
INTJ	there is not enough religion in the world even to destroy religion .
ENFP	religion is just mind control .
ENTP	it s not surprising , then , they get bitter , they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who are not like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations .
ENFP	the more powerful and original a mind , the more it will incline towards the religion of solitude .
INTJ	religion is the opium of the masses .

ESFP	i do not necessarily believe in organized religion .

ESTP	selfishness is the only real atheism aspiration , unselfishness , the only real religion .
INTP	i am against religion because it teaches us to be satisfied with not understanding the world .
ENTP	nothing can be more contrary to religion and the clergy than reason and common sense .
ENTP	it was not a religion that attacked us that september day . it was al-qaeda . we will not sacrifice the liberties we cherish or hunker down behind walls of suspicion and mistrust .
ENTJ	skeptical scrutiny is the means , in both science and religion , by which deep thoughts can be winnowed from deep nonsense .
ENTP	there is no surer sign of decay in a country than to see the rites of religion held in contempt .
ENTP	i say quite deliberately that the christian religion , as organized in its churches , has been and still is the principal enemy of moral progress in the world .
ESTP	whoever seeks to set one religion against another seeks to destroy all religion .
INTJ	religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature , the heart of a heartless world , and the soul of soulless conditions . it is the opium of the people .
ISTJ	religion is an illusion and it derives its strength from the fact that it falls in with our instinctual desires .
INTP	one of the things that is wrong with religion is that it teaches us to be satisfied with answers which are not really answers at all .
INFP	as with the christian religion , the worst advertisement for socialism is its adherents .
ENTJ	religion is excellent stuff for keeping common people quiet .
ESTJ	in nearly every religion i am aware of , there is a variation of the golden rule . and even for the non-religious , it is a tenet of people who believe in humanistic principles .
INTP	many of us saw religion as harmless nonsense . beliefs might lack all supporting evidence but , we thought , if people needed a crutch for consolation , where s the harm ? september 11th changed all that .
ENTP	we are a nation that is unenlightened because of religion . i do believe that . i think religion stops people from thinking . i think it justified crazies .
INTJ	the day is not far off when the economic problem will take the back seat where it belongs , and the arena of the heart and the head will be occupied or reoccupied , by our real problems - the problems of life and of human relations , of creation and behavior and religion .
ENTP	nothing is so fatal to religion as indifference .
ENTP	superstition is the religion of feeble minds .

ENTP	i think flying planes into a building was a faith-based initiative . i think religion is a neurological disorder .
INTP	it would be intolerant if i advocated the banning of religion , but of course i never have .
ISFP	the humanists  replacement for religion : work really hard and somehow you will either save yourself or you will be immortal . of course , that s a total joke , and our progress is nothing . there may be progress in technology but there s no ethical progress whatsoever .
ENFP	religion is not a department of life it is something that enters into the whole of it .
ENTP	the christian religion not only was at first attended with miracles , but even at this day can not be believed by any reasonable person without one .
INFJ	my first memories of religion were being taken to episcopal church . my father was catholic , but my mother , i believe , was episcopal . so i sort of veered off into the watered-down version of catholicism .
INTP	religion is the recognition of all our duties as divine commands .
INTJ	there is no higher religion than human service . to work for the common good is the greatest creed .
ENTP	generally speaking , the errors in religion are dangerous those in philosophy only ridiculous .
ESFP	you know , religion itself , eastern and western , is divisive and quarrelsome anyway .
ENFP	i do not have a religion . i believe in a god . i do not know what it looks like but it s my god . my own interpretation of the supernatural .
ISTP	if i do not talk about my religion , if i say i am not discussing it or different humanitarian things i am working on , they are like , he s avoiding it .  if i do talk about it , it becomes , oh , he s proselytizing . 
ESFJ	god s love is too great to be confined to any one side of a conflict or to any one religion .
ENTJ	it s one thing to be religious , but it s another thing to make religion your policy .
INTJ	religion is compulsory in english schools , you know .
INTJ	religion is not going to come up with any new arguments .
INTJ	i do not think romney is wacky at all , but religion makes intelligent people say and do wacky things , believe and affirm crazy things . left on his own , romney would never have said something like the garden of eden was in missouri , and will be again .
INFP	the fact that religion plays such a part in how people vote troubles me , troubles me as a minister s daughter . because i always felt that the separation of church and state was what our forefathers and foremothers really fought for .
ENFJ	there s a gullible side to the american people . they can be easily misled . religion is the best device used to mislead them .
ENFP	i am very interested in religion as something to study , but i am not a religious person in the slightest .
ENFP	religion leaves no room for human complexity .
ESFP	i am not defined by where i came from . i never took part in the rules and hatred that sometimes go along with religion . but if my parents are happy with what they believe , then i am happy to stay out of their way . we agree to disagree .
ESFJ	i love the idea of the teachings of jesus christ and the beautiful stories about it , which i loved in sunday school and i collected all the little stickers and put them in my book . but the reality is that organised religion does not seem to work . it turns people into hateful lemmings and it s not really compassionate .
ENFJ	religion can be the enemy of god . it s often what happens when god , like elvis , has left the building .
ESFP	the major civilizing force in the world is not religion , it is sex .
INFJ	i do not know how to teach philosophy without becoming a disturber of established religion .
ISFJ	i love religion .
ESTJ	9/11 was a deliberate , carefully planned evil act of the long-waged war on the west by koran-inspired soldiers of allah around the world . they hated us before george w. bush was in office . they hated us before israel existed . and the avengers of the religion of perpetual outrage will keep hating us .
ENFP	if i were asked for a one-sentence sound bite on religion , i would say i was against it .
ENFP	i was 21 in 1968 , so i am as much a child of the 60s as is possible to be . in those years the subject of religion had really almost disappeared the idea that religion was going to be a major force in the life of our societies , in the west anyway , would have seemed absurd in 1968 .
ISTJ	well , right now , i am very fascinated with 1920s berlin . i mean , probably the more interesting thing would be to go to the beginning of civilization or precivilization - like polytheistic times . it would be interesting to see what came before modern religion and culture - what circumstances created the environment or the need for it .
ISTJ	you know , i get much more jewish in israel because i like the way that religion is done there .
ESTJ	twenty five percent of israeli citizens are not even jewish . anybody can become an israeli citizen if you qualify . religion is not a criterion for citizenship .
ESFJ	i love it when the left and when the president say , do not try to impose your values on us , you folks who hold your bibles in your hand and cling to your guns .  they have values too . our values are based on religion , based on life . their values are based on a religion of self .
ESTJ	when asked if i consider myself buddhist , the answer is , not really . but it s more my religion than any other because i was brought up with it in an intellectual and spiritual environment . i do not practice or preach it , however .
ESFJ	first of all , the jewish religion has a great deal in common with the christian religion because , as rabbi gillman points out in the show , christianity is based on judaism . christ was jewish .
ISFP	it s fun being in islamic countries , to know there s only one religion . there s order . you wear a burqa . there s no choice . people are happy with that .
ENFJ	to play june , i had an immediate connect with her background and culture . we grew up with the same religion and shared a lot of the same values of family and spirituality . but i was really so inspired by what a modern woman she was .
ESFJ	i found it interesting that as people become more technically oriented all over the world , at the same time people are becoming increasingly spiritual . the success of the da vinci code - even though it was a great yawn - also showed people s interest in religion .
ESTP	the only difference is that religion is much better organised and has been around much longer , but it s the same story with different characters and different costumes .
ENFJ	an individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust , and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice , is in reality expressing the highest respect for the law .
INTP	everyone should be respected as an individual , but no one idolized .
INTP	let every man be respected as an individual and no man idolized .

INTP	if once you forfeit the confidence of your fellow-citizens , you can never regain their respect and esteem .
ENFP	when people do not respect us we are sharply offended yet in his private heart no man much respects himself .
INTJ	go up close to your friend , but do not go over to him ! we should also respect the enemy in our friend .
INFP	i have no right , by anything i do or say , to demean a human being in his own eyes . what matters is not what i think of him it is what he thinks of himself . to undermine a man s self-respect is a sin .
ENTP	to the living we owe respect , but to the dead we owe only the truth .
ENFJ	to be one , to be united is a great thing . but to respect the right to be different is maybe even greater .
ENFJ	one who breaks an unjust law that conscience tells him is unjust , and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice , is in reality expressing the highest respect for law .
ENFJ	i submit that an individual who breaks the law that conscience tells him is unjust and willingly accepts the penalty by staying in jail to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice , is in reality expressing the very highest respect for law .
ESTP	the british nation is unique in this respect . they are the only people who like to be told how bad things are , who like to be told the worst .
ESTP	we do not covet anything from any nation except their respect .
ENTP	we are more thoroughly an enlightened people , with respect to our political interests , than perhaps any other under heaven . every man among us reads , and is so easy in his circumstances as to have leisure for conversations of improvement and for acquiring information .
ENTP	one should respect public opinion insofar as is necessary to avoid starvation and keep out of prison , but anything that goes beyond this is voluntary submission to an unnecessary tyranny .
INTP	there may be fairies at the bottom of the garden . there is no evidence for it , but you ca not prove that there are not any , so should not we be agnostic with respect to fairies ?
ISFJ	we reserve our deepest respect and admiration for those who volunteer for service and give their lives to help keep our nation secure .
ESTJ	we learned about gratitude and humility - that so many people had a hand in our success , from the teachers who inspired us to the janitors who kept our school clean ... and we were taught to value everyone s contribution and treat everyone with respect .
INTJ	i hate victims who respect their executioners .
ENTP	there is no need to worry about mere size . we do not necessarily respect a fat man more than a thin man . sir isaac newton was very much smaller than a hippopotamus , but we do not on that account value him less .
ENTJ	respect the burden .
ENTP	against my will , in the course of my travels , the belief that everything worth knowing was known at cambridge gradually wore off . in this respect my travels were very useful to me .
ISTJ	find your self-respect now . do not dumb yourselves down . think of yourself as capable and worthy of finding a guy who is going to respect you , too . it s so important , i mean , and the confidence you get from feeling smart and tackling something like mathematics , which is a challenge , right ? math is hard .
ESTJ	i , for one , respect those who believe with all their hearts and conscience that there are no circumstances under which any abortion should ever be available .
ESTP	i have more respect for a man who lets me know where he stands , even if he s wrong . than the one who comes up like an angel and is nothing but a devil .
ESTP	the arab league tells us to go in and take out qaddafi . we have spent billions of dollars already with respect to the arab league . billions of dollars , because they told us to do it . why are not they paying for it ? they do not like qaddafi , qaddafi s been a terrible thorn in their side .
INTP	respect for right conduct is felt by every body .
ESTP	i love making new friends and i respect people for a lot of different reasons .

ENFP	i like to be bought flowers and taken out for dinner . i like a man to be a gentleman . i do not like to be treated as if i am brainless . i like to be respected and to give respect .
ISFP	i do not believe war is a way to solve problems . i think it s wrong . i do not have respect for the people that made the decisions to go on with war . i do not have that much respect for bush . he s about war , i am not about war - a lot of people are not about war .
ENTP	i think every religious person should have a deep sense of respect for other people s religious documents and religious symbols just as we were deeply opposed to the taliban destroying the two historic buddhas which they blew up . so i think we ought to all oppose burning the koran .
INTJ	i do not envy or much respect people who are completely politicised .
ESTP	when i am getting to know someone , i look for someone who has passions that i respect , like his career . someone who loves what he does is really attractive .
INTJ	i will not speak with disrespect of the republican party . i always speak with respect of the past .
ESFJ	to get down to the quick of it , respect motivates me - not success .
ESFJ	what i respect as far as in myself and in others is the spirit of just doing it . for better or worse , it may work and it may not , but i am going to go for it . ultimately i probably prefer to be respected for that than whether it works out or not , either winning or losing .
ESFP	i am a good girl because i really believe in love , integrity , and respect .
ISFP	i really do not spend any time on the internet , so i guess i live a little under a rock in that respect .
ISFJ	the masters is where i won my first major , and i view this tournament with great respect . after a long and necessary time away from the game , i feel like i am ready to start my season at augusta .
ISFJ	i will have to earn trust and respect from my kids .
ENTP	i have always had great respect for paddington because he is amusingly english and eccentric . he is a great british institution and my generation grew up with the books and then michael horden s animations .
INFP	if i respect myself and believe in what i am doing , no one can touch me .
ENFJ	there s one advantage in having been around as long as i have . everybody in the senate knows me , and - i am going to say something presumptuous , to repeat myself - i think most respect me .
ESFJ	you totally value and respect your body as you get older .
INTJ	hip-hop is more about attaining wealth . people respect success . they respect big . they do not even have to like your music . if you are big enough , people are drawn to you .
ISFP	i remember i read this harsh review about my show , and one of my friends told me that this was the exact same stuff people said about madonna . and it s like , she did not care . madonna just came out and was herself . i respect that a lot .
INTJ	i have respect for beer .
INFJ	all due respect and trying to be as modest as i can be , i am a dancer . but i do not think i would be on dancing with the stars ,  mainly because i would be too shy .
ISFJ	i know people that i respect and admire and look up to who have had extra-marital affairs .
ENTJ	i think we need to significantly reduce the regulatory burden on the private sector . the obama administration is doing the opposite . they are loading on more and more regulation on the private respect to how the economy functions .
ISFP	that s the most important thing to me - that if i am gon na spend however long it takes to make a movie , give up 14 hours a day for however many weeks or months , then it s very important for me to know that i am working with people who i respect and enjoy and that we are going for something together .
ISTP	i have respect for what other people believe . what i believe in my own life is that it s a search for how i can do things better , whether it s being a better man or a better father or finding ways for myself to improve .
ESFJ	i always remember having a healthy respect for my grandmother .
ENFJ	in fact i am quite snappy and irritable , and i do not know if i d like to make myself worse in that respect .
INFJ	i do think that , at one time , being an actress was the equivalent almost of being a prostitute . it garnered roughly the same respect . that s changed a lot , thank goodness .
INFP	i am definitely bicoastal , but i have to say , it s easier to live in new york than in l.a . i feel like people respect other people s space a bit more here .
INTJ	i was always fascinated by engineering . maybe it was an attempt maybe to get my father s respect or interest , or maybe it was just a genetic love of technology , but i was always trying to build things .
ESTJ	americans will respect your beliefs if you just keep them private .
ENFP	and they like being able to turn on the television day in and day out to see someone that they know and they feel comfortable with and trust hopefully and respect even .
ESFP	a lot of the time , the way it s portrayed is that i only see women in a sexual way . but i grew up with just my mum and sister , so i respect women a lot .
ESFJ	i want to be remembered as somebody that tried to respect her integrity as an artist and as a person . and i do not want to be in any box . i do not want to be one thing .
ESTJ	you respect all of these people that you know in the business as actors . and they sort of turn around and say , we really like your work . it s a nice acknowledgment .
ENTP	we are in such a volatile climate right now politically . i think they did not want assassins to not succeed due to popular opinion and politics , versus on its own merits . i can respect that .
ENFP	deceiving others . that is what the world calls a romance .
ESTJ	the word romance ,  according to the dictionary , means excitement , adventure , and something extremely real . romance should last a lifetime .
INFP	the telephone , which interrupts the most serious conversations and cuts short the most weighty observations , has a romance of its own .
ISTP	i think romance is anything honest . as long as it s honest , it s so disarming .
ESTP	remember , beneath every cynic there lies a romantic , and probably an injured one .
ESTJ	i am a feminist , but i think that romance has been taken away a bit for my generation . i think what people connect with in novels is this idea of an overpowering , encompassing love - and it being more important and special than anything and everything else .
ESFP	i believe that when you are in love you have to pour your heart and soul out to your partner ... or why bother ? so in that sense i am an incurable romantic when it comes to men .
ESTP	there s something really great and romantic about being poor and sleeping on couches .
ISTJ	we believe that according the name investors  to institutions that trade actively is like calling someone who repeatedly engages in one-night stands a romantic .

ISTJ	i love surprises - champagne and strawberries , all that pampering , romantic stuff . guys ought to know how to pamper their women properly .
ENTP	if a man lets all of my dogs sleep in the bed with us , then that is the most romantic thing . you must love my dogs in order to love me . a man who is nice to my animals and does not shoo them away - well , that s the height of romance .
ENFJ	i do not get off on romantic parts . but i often think if i had had my dental work done early on , well , maybe .
ESTJ	i am very romantic and of course i want to be in love .
ENFJ	i joined the air force . i took to it immediately when i arrived there . i did three years , eight months , and ten days in all , but it took me a year and a half to get disabused of my romantic notions about it .
ENFJ	i have never acted he has never been cast in a romantic lead or has been cast opposite a female love interest in any movie he starred in .
ISFJ	i want to do the romantic comedies . you know , the stuff that meg ryan and julia roberts or reese witherspoon would choose , of course .
ENFP	usually comedy is only available to us ladies in the romantic comedy . that s why i hate romantic comedies .

ENTP	my new movie , fools rush in , is a romantic comedy and the girl i play in that is very warm , very sweet .
ISTP	i will never say never , but i will say never to doing the more typical romantic comedies . you know , unless i am getting audited and i am on the street and i desperately need some dough and that s the only thing that i am getting .
ISTP	the only thing i would unequivocally say is that i have never had any interest in romantic comedy i just could not do it . i think i d be terrible .
ISFJ	i am a hopeless romantic . and i wo not stop till i get it right .
ISFJ	even actresses that you really admire , like reese witherspoon , you think , another romantic comedy ?  you see her in something like walk the line  and think , god , you are so great !  and then you think , why is she doing these stupid romantic comedies ?  but of course , it s for money and status .
INFP	i have always been attracted to romantic secondhand clothes . but my style developed as i started going to these strange raves where everybody had these very definitive costumes .
ESFP	i am probably a bit romantic about it , but i think we humans miss having contact with fire . we need it .
ISTP	i am a romantic .
INFJ	if i were given a choice between two films and one was dark and explored depraved , troubled or sick aspects of our culture , i would always opt for that over the next romantic comedy .
ESFP	i am better with my hands , and i always loved the slightly romantic idea of starting with bits of wood and being able to create something to sit on , to eat from , to store your clothes in .
ENFP	my music is bejewelled , it s colourful , it s romantic , it shines .
ENTP	i am the first one who sees every romantic comedy in theaters .
ISTP	mind you , roman holiday - which is kind of a romantic comedy - is one of my favorite films , and i think audrey hepburn is absolutely phenomenal in that movie .
ESTJ	i d like to classify my life as a romantic comedy . unfortunately i feel it s probably more like a tv reality show .
INFJ	for a romantic comedy to be three hours long , that s longer than most marriages .
ENTP	the reason i turn down 99 % of a hundred , i mean a thousand , scripts is because romantic comedies are often very romantic but seldom very funny .
ISFJ	you wo not find me in a romantic comedy . those movies do not speak to me . people do not come to talk to me about those scripts , because they probably think i am this dark , twisted , miserable person .
ENFP	participate joyfully in the sorrows of the world . we can not cure the world of sorrows , but we can choose to live in joy .
ISFP	and i remember going to the record studio and there was a park across the street and i d see all the children playing and i would cry because it would make me sad that i would have to work instead .
INTP	is not it sad to go to your grave without ever wondering why you were born ? who , with such a thought , would not spring from bed , eager to resume discovering the world and rejoicing to be part of it ?
INFP	can i see another s woe , and not be in sorrow too ? can i see another s grief , and not seek for kind relief ?
ENFP	i was raised in an atmosphere of everything s fine .  but as i got older , i was like , well no , everything s not fine . there is stuff that s sad .  i am a really sensitive person . i think i am too sensitive sometimes .
INTP	when i seemed to be irritable or sad , my father would quote the learned dr. knight , and then say , just go to sleep .  like all smart aleck kids , i thought the advice was silly . but as i have grown older , i have realized just how smart knight was .
ENFP	my parents  divorce left me with a lot of sadness and pain and acting , and especially humour , was my way of dealing with all that .
INFJ	it s a source of great sadness to me that my father died without having seen me do anything worthwhile . he was constantly having to make excuses for me .

ENFP	it is a very sad thing that nowadays there is so little useless information .
ESTP	i did not really want to live , so anything that was an investment in time made me angry ... but also i just felt sad . when the hopelessness is hurting you , it s the fixtures and fittings that finish you off .
ENTP	he is a hard man who is only just , and a sad one who is only wise .
ENTP	he who is not just is severe , he who is not wise is sad .

INFJ	the sad souls of those who lived without blame and without praise .
ENFJ	sometimes i wonder if suicides are not in fact sad guardians of the meaning of life .

ISTP	being on your own would be sad , sick and weird . i do not trust myself . i need that balance .
ISTP	the sad thing is that i feel so boring because twilight  is literally how every conversation i have these days begins - whether it s someone i am meeting for the first time or someone i just have not seen in a while . the first thing i want to say to them is , it s insane ! and , as a person , i ca not do anything ! 
ISTP	i have got to be high class ... which is sad , because i like bars .
ENTJ	we are sad about some of the losses of members of great seniority and distinction in the congress , and some very new members , who will no longer be serving with us .
ISFJ	i am not sad at all about turning 40 .
ENTP	apart from the fact that your physical ability starts to decline , i also think someone in their fifties being childlike becomes a little sad . you have got to be careful .

ESFP	you have got a beautiful country with so many beautiful people and so many beautiful things happening and stuff like that lets it down . i feel sad for them .
ENFJ	i never get scared making these kinds of movies because it s all make-believe , but i did cry when i saw the finished version of man on fire because it is so sad .
ENFJ	the hardest thing is at the end you have to say bye to all these people who you have worked with for so many months . it was really sad not to see them anymore . but you have the parties that you go to and you get to see them , like the premieres and the screenings .
ENFJ	no not really , it is just like real life . not everyday you are happy and not everyday you are sad .
INFP	one of the sad things about contemporary journalism is that it actually matters very little . the world now is almost inured to the power of journalism . the best journalism would manage to outrage people . and people are less and less inclined to outrage .
INTP	only two things are infinite , the universe and human stupidity , and i am not sure about the former .
INTP	no amount of experimentation can ever prove me right a single experiment can prove me wrong .
INTP	each problem that i solved became a rule , which served afterwards to solve other problems .
INFJ	your theory is crazy , but it s not crazy enough to be true .
INTJ	there is a single light of science , and to brighten it anywhere is to brighten it everywhere .
INTP	adventure upon all the tickets in the lottery , and you lose for certain and the greater the number of your tickets the nearer your approach to this certainty .

INTP	the man of science is a poor philosopher .
ENFP	success is a science if you have the conditions , you get the result .
ENFP	romance should never begin with sentiment . it should begin with science and end with a settlement .
ESFP	let both sides seek to invoke the wonders of science instead of its terrors . together let us explore the stars , conquer the deserts , eradicate disease , tap the ocean depths , and encourage the arts and commerce .
ENTJ	we live in a society exquisitely dependent on science and technology , in which hardly anyone knows anything about science and technology .
INTJ	individual science fiction stories may seem as trivial as ever to the blinder critics and philosophers of today - but the core of science fiction , its essence has become crucial to our salvation if we are to be saved at all .
ENTJ	if we long to believe that the stars rise and set for us , that we are the reason there is a universe , does science do us a disservice in deflating our conceits ?
ISTP	when i die , i am leaving my body to science fiction .
ENTP	science is what you know , philosophy is what you do not know .

ENFP	science has explained nothing the more we know the more fantastic the world becomes and the profounder the surrounding darkness .
ENTJ	i have seen firsthand that agricultural science has enormous potential to increase the yields of small farmers and lift them out of hunger and poverty .
INTP	false facts are highly injurious to the progress of science , for they often endure long but false views , if supported by some evidence , do little harm , for every one takes a salutary pleasure in proving their falseness .

ENTJ	we have arranged a civilization in which most crucial elements profoundly depend on science and technology .

INTJ	natural science will in time incorporate into itself the science of man , just as the science of man will incorporate into itself natural science : there will be one science .
INTP	i am one of those scientists who feels that it is no longer enough just to get on and do science . we have to devote a significant proportion of our time and resources to defending it from deliberate attack from organised ignorance .
INTP	the enlightenment is under threat . so is reason . so is truth . so is science , especially in the schools of america .
INTJ	the usual approach of science of constructing a mathematical model can not answer the questions of why there should be a universe for the model to describe . why does the universe go to all the bother of existing ?
INTJ	science is not only a disciple of reason but , also , one of romance and passion .
INTJ	science fiction writers foresee the inevitable , and although problems and catastrophes may be inevitable , solutions are not .
INTJ	the universe is governed by science . but science tells us that we ca not solve the equations , directly in the abstract .
INTP	of course in science there are things that are open to doubt and things need to be discussed . but among the things that science does know , evolution is about as certain as anything we know .
INTJ	to me there has never been a higher source of earthly honor or distinction than that connected with advances in science .
INTJ	science predicts that many different kinds of universe will be spontaneously created out of nothing . it is a matter of chance which we are in .

INTJ	philosophers have not kept up with modern developments in science . particularly physics .
INTJ	the media need superheroes in science just as in every sphere of life , but there is really a continuous range of abilities with no clear dividing line .
INTJ	i used to think information was destroyed in black hole . this was my biggest blunder , or at least my biggest blunder in science .
INTP	science coverage could be improved by the recognition that science is timeless , and therefore science stories should not need to be pegged to an item in the news .
INTJ	the method of political science is the interpretation of life its instrument is insight , a nice understanding of subtle , unformulated conditions .
ESFP	traditional science assumes , for the most part , that an objective observer independent reality exists the universe , stars , galaxies , sun , moon and earth would still be there if no one was looking .
ESFP	we must revisit the idea that science is a methodology and not an ontology .
ESFP	i want to be the cecil b. demille of science fiction .
INTP	in science , we must be interested in things , not in persons .
INFP	that s the whole problem with science . you have got a bunch of empiricists trying to describe things of unimaginable wonder .
INFJ	man has to awaken to wonder - and so perhaps do peoples . science is a way of sending him to sleep again .
INTP	after all , science is essentially international , and it is only through lack of the historical sense that national qualities have been attributed to it .
INFJ	as soon as questions of will or decision or reason or choice of action arise , human science is at a loss .
ISTJ	millions of people were inspired by the apollo program . i was five years old when i watched apollo 11 unfold on television , and without any doubt it was a big contributor to my passions for science , engineering , and exploration .
ENTJ	the science linking the increased frequency and severity of extreme weather to the climate crisis has matured tremendously in the last couple of years .
ENTP	the violent reaction on the recent development of modern physics can only be understood when one realises that here the foundations of physics have started moving and that this motion has caused the feeling that the ground would be cut from science .
ISTP	rocket science  is really where i fell in love with filmmaking , i think camp  was incredible , but it was so bizarre , and i was trying to find my footing in this world where you do not have an audience for immediate validation .
ENTP	teachers started recognizing me and praising me for being smart in science and that made me want to be even smarter in science !
INTJ	i had read tons of science fiction . i was fascinated by other worlds , other environments . for me , it was fantasy , but it was not fantasy in the sense of pure escapism .
INTP	i do not really see science fiction as fiction . i can imagine colonies on mars and everything .
ENTP	i was a daydreamer , and there is a lot of history and geography and science i missed out on because i was in my head . and i regret that .
ENTP	science may be described as the art of systematic over-simplification .
ENTP	science must begin with myths , and with the criticism of myths .
ENTP	in the spirit of science , there really is no such thing as a failed experiment .  any test that yields valid data is a valid test .
ENTP	that s the show . it s like 5 minutes of science and then 10 minutes of me hurting myself .
ENTP	we did not set out to be educators or even scientists , and we do not purport that what we do is real science but we are demonstrating a methodology by which one can engage and satisfy your curiosity .
ENTP	in some parts of life , like mathematics and science , yeah , i was a genius . i would top all the top scores you could ever measure it by .
ISFP	there s a lot of interesting words , nomenclatures , in science .
INTP	one of the reasons i did this , because i was not really looking for another science fiction film , was that my daughter can see it . she s 9 and it s really a good film for all ages .
INTJ	i felt that chess ... is a science in the form of a game ... i consider myself a scientist . i wanted to be treated like a scientist .
ESFJ	if you smile when no one else is around , you really mean it .
ESTP	war is a game that is played with a smile . if you ca not smile , grin . if you ca not grin , keep out of the way till you can .
ENFP	you know , i have got wrinkles on my forehead and smile lines , but what s wrong with that ? i love to smile .
ISFP	i do not mind a little sturm und drang . when i was doing riding in cars with boys ,  i would not smile at anybody , because my character , bev , was angry at the world . i am the opposite . inside my head i d be like , god , i will explain to you at the end of shooting that i am not this person .
ESFJ	later in my life , i am going to look back and smile and be very fulfilled . i know that if i do not give it my all right now i will regret it later . that s very important to me , because i have worked all my life to have this .
ISFP	i was walking around legally blind . now i have 20-20 vision . i ca not believe i spent so many years blurry , but i think that coincides with how i was feeling . now i notice if people are watching me , but i also smile right back if someone waves , which helps .
ESFP	crowds are the most difficult thing for me these days because i have to walk with my head down and my eyes averted . there s still that part of me that wants to hold my head up , make eye contact and smile .
INFP	when you are walking down the street , or you are at a restaurant , someone catches your eye because they have their own look . it goes way beyond what they are wearing - into their mannerisms , the way they smile , or just the way they hold themselves .
ISTJ	a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both .
INTP	we have a system that increasingly taxes work and subsidizes nonwork .
INTP	no society can surely be flourishing and happy , of which the far greater part of the members are poor and miserable .
INFP	society has always seemed to demand a little more from human beings than it will get in practice .
ESFP	we must reject the idea that every time a law s broken , society is guilty rather than the lawbreaker . it is time to restore the american precept that each individual is accountable for his actions .
INFP	our society is run by insane people for insane objectives . i think we are being run by maniacs for maniacal ends and i think i am liable to be put away as insane for expressing that . that s what s insane about it .
ENFJ	discrimination is a hellhound that gnaws at negroes in every waking moment of their lives to remind them that the lie of their inferiority is accepted as truth in the society dominating them .
INTP	all that is valuable in human society depends upon the opportunity for development accorded the individual .
ENFJ	it is incontestable and deplorable that negroes have committed crimes but they are derivative crimes . they are born of the greater crimes of the white society .
ESFP	if a free society can not help the many who are poor , it can not save the few who are rich .
ENFP	clothes make the man . naked people have little or no influence on society .
ENFP	in a closed society where everybody s guilty , the only crime is getting caught . in a world of thieves , the only final sin is stupidity .
ENFP	the finest clothing made is a person s own skin , but , of course , society demands something more than this .
ESFP	the very word secrecy  is repugnant in a free and open society and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies , to secret oaths , and to secret proceedings .
INFJ	i know of no safe depository of the ultimate powers of the society but the people themselves and if we think them not enlightened enough to exercise their control with a wholesome discretion , the remedy is not to take it from them but to inform their discretion .
INFJ	truth is certainly a branch of morality and a very important one to society .
INFJ	i claim that human mind or human society is not divided into watertight compartments called social , political and religious . all act and react upon one another .
ENFP	if one could only teach the english how to talk , and the irish how to listen , society here would be quite civilized .
ENFP	society exists only as a mental concept in the real world there are only individuals .
INFP	my role in society , or any artist s or poet s role , is to try and express what we all feel . not to tell people how to feel . not as a preacher , not as a leader , but as a reflection of us all .
ESTP	to educate a man in mind and not in morals is to educate a menace to society .
ENFP	i suppose society is wonderfully delightful . to be in it is merely a bore . but to be out of it is simply a tragedy .
INFP	the basic thing nobody asks is why do people take drugs of any sort ? why do we have these accessories to normal living to live ? i mean , is there something wrong with society that s making us so pressurized , that we can not live without guarding ourselves against it ?
ENFJ	there can be no keener revelation of a society s soul than the way in which it treats its children .
INFP	the society based on production is only productive , not creative .
ENFJ	i have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities .
ENFJ	i should tie myself to no particular system of society other than of socialism .
ISTP	crimes against children are the most heinous crime . that , for me , would be a reason for capital punishment because children are innocent and need the guidance of an adult society .
ISTJ	the smarter the journalists are , the better off society is . for to a degree , people read the press to inform themselves - and the better the teacher , the better the student body .
ENTP	in december , i agreed to extend the tax cuts for the wealthiest americans because it was the only way i could prevent a tax hike on middle-class americans . but we can not afford $ 1 trillion worth of tax cuts for every millionaire and billionaire in our society . we ca not afford it . and i refuse to renew them again .
INFJ	we live in a society of victimization , where people are much more comfortable being victimized than actually standing up for themselves .
INTJ	individual rights are the means of subordinating society to moral law .
ENTP	society therefore is an ancient as the world .
INTJ	in a higher phase of communist society ... only then can the narrow horizon of bourgeois right be fully left behind and society inscribe on its banners : from each according to his ability , to each according to his needs .
ENTP	princes and governments are far more dangerous than other elements within society .
ESTP	we are trying to construct a more inclusive society . we are going to make a country in which no one is left out .
ENTJ	although i do not have a prescription for what others should do , i know i have been very fortunate and feel a responsibility to give back to society in a very significant way .
ISTP	society is at odds with itself .
ISTP	our modern society - especially in the west , and especially now - reveres youth .
ISFJ	i will spend the next four years rebuilding the foundation of a opportunity society led by free people and free enterprises .
ISTP	the most important element of a free society , where individual rights are held in the highest esteem , is the rejection of the initiation of violence .
INTJ	in bourgeois society capital is independent and has individuality , while the living person is dependent and has no individuality .
ENTJ	a first-generation fortune is the most likely to be given away , but once a fortune is inherited it s less likely that a very high percentage will go back to society .
ENTJ	i think the first duty of society is justice .
INTJ	society does not consist of individuals but expresses the sum of interrelations , the relations within which these individuals stand .
INTJ	when i read about the way in which library funds are being cut and cut , i can only think that american society has found one more way to destroy itself .
INTJ	in our society , the women who break down barriers are those who ignore limits .
INTJ	the ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas , i.e. , the class which is the ruling material force of society , is at the same time its ruling intellectual force .
INTJ	the human being is in the most literal sense a political animal , not merely a gregarious animal , but an animal which can individuate itself only in the midst of society .
ENTP	society can overlook murder , adultery or swindling it never forgives preaching of a new gospel .
INTP	well first of all , tell me , is there some society you know of that does not run on greed ? you think russia does not run on greed ? you think china does not run on greed ? what is greed ?
ENTP	nobility is a graceful ornament to the civil order . it is the corinthian capital of polished society .
ESFJ	what you are seeing with occupy wall street and the others are people who are unhappy and they are directing their unhappiness now toward wall street and toward those they think are doing too well in our society .
INFJ	society cares for the individual only so far as he is profitable .
ESTP	i believe we can continue the great society while we fight in vietnam .
INTP	the reason why men enter into society is the preservation of their property .
ENTP	the individual is not accountable to society for his actions in so far as these concern the interests of no person but himself .
ENTP	the only part of the conduct of any one , for which he is amenable to society , is that which concerns others . in the part which merely concerns himself , his independence is , of right , absolute . over himself , over his own body and mind , the individual is sovereign .
ESFP	once the fabric of a just society is undone , it takes generations to weave it back together .
ENFP	a society that has more justice is a society that needs less charity .
INFJ	society , being codified by man , decrees that woman is inferior she can do away with this inferiority only by destroying the male s superiority .
ESTP	to conclude that women are unfitted to the task of our historic society seems to me the equivalent of closing male eyes to female facts .
ESFJ	all the united states , it is a society that is split like to the bottom , that had very poor people in the country that is one of the wealthiest countries .
INTP	if we try to engineer outcomes , if we overturn tradition to make everyone the same , we ruin society . if we upset tradition to allow for an equal shot at the starting gate , everyone wins , except for the charlatans and would be dictators .
INTJ	if you look at any muslim society and you make a scale of how developed they are , and how successful the economy is , it s a straight line . it depends on how much they emancipate their women .
ESTP	we have the opportunity to move not only toward the rich society and the powerful society , but upward to the great society .
ENFP	ironing boards are a classic example of something i find horrible about modern society : the excitementation , for want of a better word , of mundane things .
ENFJ	for too long in this society , we have celebrated unrestrained individualism over common community .
ENTJ	we live in an image society . speeches are not what anybody cares about what they care about is the picture .

ISFP	the true meaning of feminism is this : to use your strong womanly image to gain strong results in society .
INTJ	no one has done a study on this , as far as i can tell , but i think facebook might be the first place where a large number of people have come out . we did not create that - society was generally ready for that . i think this is just part of the general trend that we talked about , about society being more open , and i think that s good .
INFJ	i do earnestly wish to see the distinction of sex confounded in society , unless where love animates the behaviour .
ESFJ	what is missing from today s dialogue is the effect autism is having on families , our society and what the unknown factors are . the 300lb . gorilla in the room is that our children with autism today will soon become adults with autism .
ISTJ	i want to help middle-school girls stay interested in math and be good at it , and see it as friendly and accessible and not this scary thing . everyone else in society tells them it s not for them . it s for nerdy white guys with pocket protectors .
ENFJ	the devastating punch we took on september 11th still reverberates throughout american society .
ENFJ	we must rekindle the fire of idealism in our society .

ESFP	if you let society and your peers define who you are , you are the less for it .
ENFP	the only way of living in a free society is to feel that you have the right to say and do stuff .
ENFP	the response of anybody interested in liberty is that we all have a say and the ability to have an argument is exactly what liberty is , even though it may never be resolved . in any authoritarian society the possessor of power dictates , and if you try and step outside he will come after you .
INTP	my definition of a decent society is one that first of all takes care of its losers , and protects its weak .
INTP	if you ask an economist what s driven economic growth , it s been major advances in things that mattered - the mechanization of farming , mass manufacturing , things like that . the problem is , our society is not organized around doing that .
ENTP	but , actually , so many of the clerics that i have met , particularly the church of england clerics , are people of such extraordinary smugness and arrogance and conceitedness who are extraordinarily presumptuous about the significance of their position in society .
ESTJ	aids is not just god s punishment for homosexuals it is god s punishment for the society that tolerates homosexuals .
ISTJ	standards of conduct appropriate to civil society or the workings of a democracy can not be purely and simply applied to the church .
ENTJ	what does burma have to give the united states ? we can give you the opportunity to engage with people who are ready and willing to change a society .
ESTJ	but the truth of the matter is , we are an open society , we want to remain an open society , and there will continue to be vulnerability . that s why we have to meet the threats when they are not yet taking place on our territory and on our soil .
INTJ	i have , in some ways , saved characters that have been marginalized by society by playing them - and having them still have dignity and still survive , still get through it .
ENFJ	america must be the teacher of democracy , not the advertiser of the consumer society . it is unrealistic for the rest of the world to reach the american living standard .
ESTP	sometimes nudity is gratuitous . we just live in a society where everything goes .
ENFP	you forget that you do choose your life and there are so many things to be grateful for and i feel like society has gotten to that point where we are always looking for the next and the better and we lose sight of what s actually in front of us .
ENFJ	as you have fewer and fewer voices in a democracy , in a free society , it s not good to limit the number of voices .
ENFP	when the going gets weird , the weird turn pro .
ESTJ	the only time my prayers are never answered is on the golf course .
INTJ	golf is a game in which one endeavors to control a ball with implements ill adapted for the purpose .
ISFP	if your man is a sports enthusiast , you may have to resign yourself to his spouting off in a monotone on a prize fight , football game or pennant race .
ENTJ	even if i did have , you know , a sports illustrated  body , i d still wear elegant clothes .
ESFJ	i enjoy sports in person .
ENTP	i was always a sports nut but i have lost interest now in whether one bunch of mercenaries in north london is going to beat another bunch of mercenaries from west london .

ISFP	i grew up being into sports and i was not trained to move my body in the right way for dancing . i am the last one to get any moves correct . in rehearsals it s always , ok , one more take for zac . 
INTP	i have zero interest in sports of any kind - professional , college or international .
ISTJ	it certainly is dangerous that there are only a few clubs left in europe that can afford to pay millions . at the end of the day however , the spectators decide the rates of pay - by watching the games and consuming the goods and services advertised on sports tv programmes .
ESFJ	if they asked me , i did two shifts . i did sports , i did news , because i loved it .
ISTP	i love sport , i grew up playing sports , that s all i did , and it is so invigorating now that i am supposedly adult to learn something completely new , from the bottom up .
ISTP	i grew up playing sports , but now i feel like i ca not , because if i get injured , i will impair whatever film i am working on .
ESFJ	the sports page records people s accomplishments , the front page usually records nothing , but man s failures .
ESTP	everyone i know who is successful has issues with their father , regardless of whether it was sports or business or entertainment .
INTJ	i hate ready-made suits , button-down collars , and sports shirts .
ISFJ	i always loved the way music made me feel . i did sports at school and all , but when i got home , it was just music . everybody in my neighborhood loved music . i could jump the back fence and be in the park where there were ghetto blasters everywhere .
INTJ	that which does not kill us makes us stronger .
ESTP	the world breaks everyone , and afterward , some are strong at the broken places .
INTJ	strength does not come from winning . your struggles develop your strengths . when you go through hardships and decide not to surrender , that is strength .
INTP	only one who devotes himself to a cause with his whole strength and soul can be a true master . for this reason mastery demands all of a person .
ENFJ	where there is no struggle , there is no strength .
ENFJ	does anybody really think that they did not get what they had because they did not have the talent or the strength or the endurance or the commitment ?
ISTJ	do not expect to build up the weak by pulling down the strong .
ISFJ	because your own strength is unequal to the task , do not assume that it is beyond the powers of man but if anything is within the powers and province of man , believe that it is within your own compass also .
ISFJ	in all my perplexities and distresses , the bible has never failed to give me light and strength .
ENTP	what is important is to believe in something so strongly that you are never discouraged .
INFJ	strength does not come from physical capacity . it comes from an indomitable will .
ESFP	the tax on capital gains directly affects investment decisions , the mobility and flow of risk capital ... the ease or difficulty experienced by new ventures in obtaining capital , and thereby the strength and potential for growth in the economy .
INFJ	it is my own firm belief that the strength of the soul grows in proportion as you subdue the flesh .
INFJ	when restraint and courtesy are added to strength , the latter becomes irresistible .
ESTP	a nation that destroys its soils destroys itself . forests are the lungs of our land , purifying the air and giving fresh strength to our people .

ISFJ	ronald reagan was a president of strength . his philosophy was a philosophy of strength - a strong military , a strong economy and strong families .
ENTJ	my greatest strength is common sense . i am really a standard brand - like campbell s tomato soup or baker s chocolate .
ISTJ	the spirit of man is more important than mere physical strength , and the spiritual fiber of a nation than its wealth .
ISTJ	only strength can cooperate . weakness can only beg .
ISTJ	our real problem , then , is not our strength today it is rather the vital necessity of action today to ensure our strength tomorrow .
ESTP	the financial crisis should not become an excuse to raise taxes , which would only undermine the economic growth required to regain our strength .
ESTP	the men who have guided the destiny of the united states have found the strength for their tasks by going to their knees . this private unity of public men and their god is an enduring source of reassurance for the people of america .
ESTP	lust is to the other passions what the nervous fluid is to life it supports them all , lends strength to them all ambition , cruelty , avarice , revenge , are all founded on lust .
ESFJ	you really have to look inside yourself and find your own inner strength , and say , i am proud of what i am and who i am , and i am just going to be myself . 
ENTJ	i think that we had a different view of what the 21st century could be like , with much more of a sense , from our perspective , of trying to have an interdependent world : looking at solving regional conflicts , having strength in alliances , operating within some kind of a sense that we were part of the international community and not outside of it .
ESFJ	i have arm-wrestled here and there ... guys seem to want to test my strength .
INFJ	women have seldom sufficient employment to silence their feelings a round of little cares , or vain pursuits frittering away all strength of mind and organs , they become naturally only objects of sense .
INFP	i do a dance-based cardio workout infused with circuit training , and emphasizing strength and alignment .
ENTJ	i know what my limitations are as an actor , but my strength is putting myself into a well-written part . when i get in trouble is when i have to fix it , or when i have to carry it on personality .
ISTJ	so europe needs to be competitive and we also need to be competitive if we wish to remain an interesting economic partner for the united states . this has to be done on the basis of strength , of competitiveness .
ESTJ	nothing symbolizes american strength and vigor more than another unaccountable washington bureaucrat .
ENFP	military preparedness is absolutely a form of strength .
ISFJ	on set is where i feel comfortable . the red carpet stuff , talking about the film , explaining your own life , it does not come naturally . it s all necessary stuff i suppose but it s not my strength .
ESFJ	i think my best skill in this whole deal is as a conduit to try to bring people together , because i think it s in our unity that we will have the greatest strength .
ISFJ	it s funny , because in drama school , my greatest strength was my range . so my early career was like that : i played all kinds of different characters .
INTP	try not to become a man of success , but rather try to become a man of value .
INTP	always bear in mind that your own resolution to succeed is more important than any other .
ESTJ	coming together is a beginning keeping together is progress working together is success .
INTP	strive not to be a success , but rather to be of value .
ENFP	all you need is ignorance and confidence and the success is sure .
ENTJ	success is a lousy teacher . it seduces smart people into thinking they ca not lose .
ENTJ	what is success ? i think it is a mixture of having a flair for the thing that you are doing knowing that it is not enough , that you have got to have hard work and a certain sense of purpose .
ESTP	i do not measure a man s success by how high he climbs but how high he bounces when he hits bottom .
ENFP	a person with a new idea is a crank until the idea succeeds .
ESTP	the most important single ingredient in the formula of success is knowing how to get along with people .
ESTJ	if everyone is moving forward together , then success takes care of itself .
ESTP	if you have no critics you will likely have no success .
ESTP	the successful man will profit from his mistakes and try again in a different way .
ESTP	flaming enthusiasm , backed up by horse sense and persistence , is the quality that most frequently makes for success .
ISTP	eighty percent of success is showing up .
ESTP	success is how high you bounce when you hit bottom .
ESFJ	those who have succeeded at anything and do not mention luck are kidding themselves .
ESFP	we should measure welfare s success by how many people leave welfare , not by how many are added .
ENTP	without continual growth and progress , such words as improvement , achievement , and success have no meaning .
ENTP	applause waits on success .
ISFP	success makes so many people hate you . i wish it was not that way . it would be wonderful to enjoy success without seeing envy in the eyes of those around you .
ISTJ	discipline is the soul of an army . it makes small numbers formidable procures success to the weak , and esteem to all .
ESTJ	if there is any one secret of success , it lies in the ability to get the other person s point of view and see things from that person s angle as well as from your own .
ESTP	the test of success is not what you do when you are on top . success is how high you bounce when you hit bottom .
ESTJ	before everything else , getting ready is the secret of success .
ESTP	for unflagging interest and enjoyment , a household of children , if things go reasonably well , certainly all other forms of success and achievement lose their importance by comparison .
ESFP	the path to success is to take massive , determined action .
ISTJ	america is the most grandiose experiment the world has seen , but , i am afraid , it is not going to be a success .
ENTP	there is nothing more difficult to take in hand , more perilous to conduct , or more uncertain in its success , than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things .
ESFP	there s no abiding success without commitment .
ENTJ	if you wish to be a success in the world , promise everything , deliver nothing .
ENFJ	you know you are on the road to success if you would do your job , and not be paid for it .
ISFJ	i stand ready to lead us down a different path where we are lifted up by our desire to succeed , not dragged down by a resentment of success .
ESTP	if you have a success you have it for the wrong reasons . if you become popular it is always because of the worst aspects of your work .
ISFJ	forward , as occasion offers . never look round to see whether any shall note it ... be satisfied with success in even the smallest matter , and think that even such a result is no trifle .
ESTP	you never achieve success unless you like what you are doing .
INFP	you do the work and you want people to see it but , um while i am doing the work , the result does not matter at all to me . ultimately , i do not , i do not care whether the film is - you know - some big giant box-office bonanza and i do not care if its a complete flop . to me , when a film gets made and it s actually finished it s a success . they are all a success in their own way .
ESFJ	there is little success where there is little laughter .
ISFJ	if we become one of those societies that attack success , why not come as certain there will be a lot less success ? and that s not who we are .
ENTJ	in inner-city , low-income communities of color , there s such a high correlation in terms of educational quality and success .
ENTJ	well i think any author or musician is anxious to have legitimate sales of their products , partly so they are rewarded for their success , partly so they can go on and do new things .
ISTJ	if a man has been his mother s undisputed darling he retains throughout life the triumphant feeling , the confidence in success , which not seldom brings actual success along with it .
ISTJ	if i had permitted my failures , or what seemed to me at the time a lack of success , to discourage me i can not see any way in which i would ever have made progress .
ESFJ	success can make you go one of two ways . it can make you a prima donna - or it can smooth the edges , take away the insecurities , let the nice things come out .
ESTJ	whether you come from a council estate or a country estate , your success will be determined by your own confidence and fortitude .
ISTP	be yourself . follow your instincts . success depends , at least in part , on the ability to carry it off . 
ENTJ	i have learned that mistakes can often be as good a teacher as success .
INTJ	the decadent international but individualistic capitalism in the hands of which we found ourselves after the war is not a success . it is not intelligent . it is not beautiful . it is not just . it is not virtuous . and it does not deliver the goods .
ISFP	success is a beast . and it actually puts the emphasis on the wrong thing . you get away with more instead of looking within .
ENFP	while i was doing stand-up , i thought i knew for sure that success meant getting everyone to like me . so i became whoever i thought people wanted me to be . i d say yes when i wanted to say no , and i even wore a few dresses .
INFJ	when i finish a picture i do not show it to anyone if i feel it s not good enough yet . i have learnt to listen to my partners and my friends . for me it s the biggest success if they like it .
ESTP	the more defects a man may have , the older he is , the less lovable , the more resounding his success .
ESTJ	success is only meaningful and enjoyable if it feels like your own .
ISFP	i hate the idea of success robbing you of your private life .
ESFJ	think of yourself as on the threshold of unparalleled success . a whole , clear , glorious life lies before you . achieve ! achieve !
ESTP	our purpose in vietnam is to prevent the success of aggression . it is not conquest , it is not empire , it is not foreign bases , it is not domination . it is , simply put , just to prevent the forceful conquest of south vietnam by north vietnam .
ESTJ	like so many american families , our families were not asking for much . they did not begrudge anyone else s success or care that others had much more than they did ... in fact , they admired it .
ENFP	in the united states there s a puritan ethic and a mythology of success . he who is successful is good . in latin countries , in catholic countries , a successful person is a sinner .
ISFP	when success comes , people can try to trick you or take advantage of you .
INTP	personal relationships are the fertile soil from which all advancement , all success , all achievement in real life grows .
INFJ	success is survival .
ISFJ	hopefully i will continue to have the success i have had .
ISFJ	the thing you do not dream about as a kid is all the peripheral stuff that comes with success .
ESFP	it was so draining . going to parties to rub elbows with so-and-so and act like it s no big deal , when really all i was doing was hoping i d have the success they had .
ESFJ	for a good 10 to 12 years , i was working non-stop and i was not really enjoying my success .
ENTJ	democrats believe in reigniting the american dream by removing barriers to success and building ladders of opportunity for all , so everyone can succeed .
ISTP	success is always something completely different to people . i feel like i have succeeded , if i am doing something that makes me happy and i am not lying to anybody .
ESTJ	without an open-minded mind , you can never be a great success .
ENTJ	you have got to eat while you dream . you have got to deliver on short-range commitments , while you develop a long-range strategy and vision and implement it . the success of doing both . walking and chewing gum if you will . getting it done in the short-range , and delivering a long-range plan , and executing on that .
ESTP	i sort of understood that when i first started : that you should not repeat a success . very often you are going to , and maybe the first time you do , it works . and you love it . but then you are trapped .
ENFJ	i wish i could just go tell all the young women i work with , all these fabulous women , believe in yourself and negotiate for yourself . own your own success .  i wish i could tell that to my daughter . but it s not that simple .
INFP	it s so interesting how success hits people and how they react to it .
ISTP	success is always something completely different to people . i feel like i have succeeded , if i am doing something that makes me happy and i am not lying to anybody . i am not doing that now , so i feel really good about myself .
ISTP	this weird thing happens when you are in a movie that has some level of success . people start offering you all kinds of things , and they just expect you to do them because they will be good for your career . it s not about the project s integrity or anything like that .
ENFP	i have learned that success comes in a very prickly package . whether you choose to accept it or not is up to you .
ESFJ	the hardest thing to find in life is balance - especially the more success you have , the more you look to the other side of the gate . what do i need to stay grounded , in touch , in love , connected , emotionally balanced ? look within yourself .
ESFP	i had a lot of success from the start . i never really was tested for long periods of time . i got my first professional job while i was a senior in college . i signed with the william morris agency before i graduated .
ENFP	the one thing that makes me feel super lucky about my financial success is that i have a housekeeper .
INFP	the quick success was a bit strange to get used to .
INTP	i have found no greater satisfaction than achieving success through honest dealing and strict adherence to the view that , for you to gain , those you deal with should gain as well .
ISTP	anyone who has to fight , even with the most modern weapons , against an enemy in complete command of the air , fights like a savage against modern european troops , under the same handicaps and with the same chances of success .
ISTP	to me , success is choice and opportunity .
ESFJ	well , you ca not be trying to achieve success of any kind in this business without accepting that there s going to be a flip side to it .
ISFP	the success of watermark surprised me . i never thought of music as something commercial it was something very personal to me .
ESFP	you wan na know what scares people ? success . when you do not make moves and when you do not climb up the ladder , everybody loves you because you are not competition .
ENTP	the key to sitcom success is miserable people . if you see a happy couple , it s just gone , like when sam and diane got together on cheers .
INFJ	with the success of the last three or so years , when a lot of people start treating you differently , there s a danger that you may start to think of yourself differently . you rely on your friends to say , hey , wake up ! 
INFJ	i came from a family where i felt great pressure to be financially successful , and i felt that staying in chicago and doing theater , i was , in all likelihood , not going to find financial success .
ISFP	when making music i sink myself into the process as deeply as i can and forget all of the success .
ISFP	the writing of a melody is an emotional moment success does not make it easy .
ISFP	fame and success are very different things .
INFP	when sorrows come , they come not single spies , but in battalions .
ENFP	if there was less sympathy in the world , there would be less trouble in the world .
ENTP	tears are the silent language of grief .
INFP	excessive sorrow laughs . excessive joy weeps .
INFJ	i have sometimes been wildly , despairingly , acutely miserable , racked with sorrow , but through it all i still know quite certainly that just to be alive is a grand thing .
ISTJ	excess of grief for the dead is madness for it is an injury to the living , and the dead know it not .
ENFJ	you do not go around grieving all the time , but the grief is still there and always will be .
ENFJ	pity may represent little more than the impersonal concern which prompts the mailing of a check , but true sympathy is the personal concern which demands the giving of one s soul .
INTJ	i am not looking for sympathy at all .
INFJ	i have always thought of acting as more of an exercise in empathy , which is not to be confused with sympathy . you are trying to get inside a certain emotional reality or motivational reality and try to figure out what that s about so you can represent it .
INTJ	interest does not tie nations together it sometimes separates them . but sympathy and understanding does unite them .
ESFJ	i like the rolling stones for karaoke . sympathy for the devil  is a great one .
INFJ	those who know how to think need no teachers .
ENTJ	if you think your teacher is tough , wait until you get a boss . he does not have tenure .
ESFJ	most of us end up with no more than five or six people who remember us . teachers have thousands of people who remember them for the rest of their lives .
ESFJ	i do not believe there is a problem in this country or the world today which could not be settled if approached through the teaching of the sermon on the mount .
ESTP	please stop teaching my children that everyone gets a trophy just for participating . what is this , the nobel prize ? not everybody gets a trophy .
ENTP	i never had to learn english , french and german because i was brought up as all three languages . i had a private french teacher before i even went to school . that helped a lot .
ENTJ	technology is just a tool . in terms of getting the kids working together and motivating them , the teacher is the most important .
ISFJ	i wanted to be a teacher .
ENFJ	a little girl who finds a puzzle frustrating might ask her busy mother ( or teacher ) for help . the child gets one message if her mother expresses clear pleasure at the request and quite another if mommy responds with a curt do not bother me - i have got important work to do . 
ESFJ	i was raised in new york city and raised in the new york city theater world . my father was a theater director and an acting teacher , and it was not uncommon for me to have long discussions about the method and what the various different processes were to finding a character and exploring character and realizing that character .
ESFJ	my job requires me to put on a little dress and run around the streets of new york in heels . but i also had the financial means to hire a yoga teacher to come to my house while my sitter watched the newborn . for 95 percent of the world , that s not realistic .
ENTP	i used to write things for friends . there was this girl i had a crush on , and she had a teacher she did not like at school . i had a real crush on her , so almost every day i would write her a little short story where she would kill him in a different way .
ENTP	i had a great drama teacher in high school , and that s when i started to learn about the history of theater .
ENFJ	i am home schooled , and i have a teacher that goes with me on all my movies .
INTP	it has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity .
ENFP	the typewriting machine , when played with expression , is no more annoying than the piano when played by a sister or near relation .
ENFP	technological progress has merely provided us with more efficient means for going backwards .
ENTJ	all of the books in the world contain no more information than is broadcast as video in a single large american city in a single year . not all bits have equal value .
ESFJ	making duplicate copies and computer printouts of things no one wanted even one of in the first place is giving america a new sense of purpose .
ENTP	it is questionable if all the mechanical inventions yet made have lightened the day s toil of any human being .
ENFP	people are stunned to hear that one company has data files on 185 million americans .
ISTP	i am sorry , it s true . having children really changes your view on these things . we are born , we live for a brief instant , and we die . it s been happening for a long time . technology is not changing it much - if at all .
ISTP	i have always wanted to own and control the primary technology in everything we do .
ISTP	the over-all point is that new technology will not necessarily replace old technology , but it will date it . by definition . eventually , it will replace it . but it s like people who had black-and-white tvs when color came out . they eventually decided whether or not the new technology was worth the investment .
INTJ	capitalist production , therefore , develops technology , and the combining together of various processes into a social whole , only by sapping the original sources of all wealth - the soil and the labourer .
ENTJ	the advance of technology is based on making it fit in so that you do not really even notice it , so it s part of everyday life .
INTP	we humans are an extremely important manifestation of the replication bomb , because it is through us - through our brains , our symbolic culture and our technology - that the explosion may proceed to the next stage and reverberate through deep space .
ENFP	technology is destructive only in the hands of people who do not realize that they are one and the same process as the universe .
ENTP	piecemeal social engineering resembles physical engineering in regarding the ends as beyond the province of technology .
ESFP	i have always felt that technology can be used to our benefit and should be used to our benefit .

INTJ	ronald reagan said that he sought a star wars defense only in order to share the technology with the tyrants of the u.s.s.r .
ENTJ	saddam hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process .
ESTJ	we are in a new world . we are in a world in which the possibility of terrorism , married up with technology , could make us very , very sorry that we did not act .
ENTJ	i believe that we were not as effective in the second term dealing with this issue of nuclear none proliferation as we had been during the first term when we stripped libya and iraq and a.q . khan and their capacity to proliferate nuclear technology .
ESTJ	there was a time when nails were high-tech . there was a time when people had to be told how to use a telephone . technology is just a tool . people use tools to improve their lives .
ESFP	i love the modern technology now .
ESTP	with the evolution of technology , kids really need to be computer-savvy .
ESTJ	there used to be this country called the soviet union it s not there anymore . our technology was better than theirs .
ESTJ	the human condition today is better than it s ever been , and technology is one of the reasons for that .
INTP	i see technology as being an extension of the human body .
INTP	technology is us . there is no separation . it s a pure expression of human creative will . it does not exist anywhere else in the universe . i am rather sure of that .
ESFJ	indiana jones is very much an old-world kind of hero . he does not really have any kind of superpower or rely on any kind of technology to help him out of things .
ESFJ	you can alter movie singing so much because you go into the recording studio and , just technology for recording has gotten so good , you can hold out a note and they can combine a note from take 2 and a note from take 8 .

INFJ	i had an almost fetishistic attraction to film technology .
INTJ	silicon valley has some of the smartest engineers and technology business people in the world .
INTP	society will decide after the technology is created what we will and wo not accept .
INTP	the best museums and museum exhibits about science or technology give you the feeling that , hey , this is interesting , but maybe i could do something here , too .
INFP	as a teenager i was so insecure . i was the type of guy that never fitted in because he never dared to choose . i was convinced i had absolutely no talent at all . for nothing . and that thought took away all my ambition too .
ISFP	my teenage years were exactly what they were supposed to be . everybody has their own path . it s laid out for you . it s just up to you to walk it .
ESFJ	so many people try to grow up too fast , and it s not fun ! you should stay a kid as long as possible !
ENFJ	i was a quiet teenager , introverted , full of angst .
ESTJ	i spent the first fourteen years of my life convinced that my looks were hideous . adolescence is painful for everyone , i know , but mine was plain weird .
ESTP	at the age of 16 i was already dreaming of having a baby because i felt myself to be an adult , but my mum forbid it . right now , i feel like a teenager and i want to have fun for one or two more years before starting a family .
ESTJ	if a movie is not a hit right out of the gate , they drop it . which means that the whole mainstream hollywood product has been skewed toward violence and vulgar teen comedy .
INFP	i was not going to have fun doing a teen movie again .
ISFP	teen pop will never die as long as there are teens and popular music . it just takes a different head .
ENFP	being a teen idol is what i have waited for my whole life .

ISTP	i am thankful for laughter , except when milk comes out of my nose .
ISFP	it s been quite a roller coaster ride , but i have grown and learned a lot about myself . the greatest thing is being able to interact with fans and touch people s lives ... for that i give thanks .
ISFP	i am very thankful to be doing what i am doing . i feel very blessed .
ENFJ	look folks , we know who built this country and we know who is going to rebuild it . it s you . instead of vilifying you , we should be thanking you . we owe you .
ENFJ	be thankful for what you have you will end up having more . if you concentrate on what you do not have , you will never , ever have enough .
INFP	the thankful receiver bears a plentiful harvest .
ESTJ	i am thankful for the incredible advances in medicine that have taken place during my lifetime . i almost certainly would not still be here if it were not for them .
ESFJ	i want to let my fans get to know a little about me . i am very thankful for everything they have done for me so , of course , i am going to let them into my world a bit . but i really am a very private person , and i love kepping my life to myself - that s how i have always been .
ENTP	lost time is never found again .
ENTP	you may delay , but time will not .
INFP	we are time s subjects , and time bids be gone .

INTP	time is what prevents everything from happening at once .
INFP	in a time of universal deceit - telling the truth is a revolutionary act .
ESTP	if you have an important point to make , do not try to be subtle or clever . use a pile driver . hit the point once . then come back and hit it again . then hit it a third time - a tremendous whack .
ESTP	there is no better than adversity . every defeat , every heartbreak , every loss , contains its own seed , its own lesson on how to improve your performance the next time .
INFP	time you enjoy wasting , was not wasted .
ENFP	some people see things that are and ask , why ? some people dream of things that never were and ask , why not ? some people have to go to work and do not have time for all that .
ENFP	the very existence of flame-throwers proves that some time , somewhere , someone said to themselves , you know , i want to set those people over there on fire , but i am just not close enough to get the job done .
INTP	when i am getting ready to reason with a man , i spend one-third of my time thinking about myself and what i am going to say and two-thirds about him and what he is going to say .
INTP	at what point then is the approach of danger to be expected ? i answer , if it ever reach us , it must spring up amongst us . it can not come from abroad . if destruction be our lot , we must ourselves be its author and finisher . as a nation of freemen , we must live through all time , or die by suicide .
INTP	there is another old poet whose name i do not now remember who said , truth is the daughter of time . 
ENFP	substitute damn  every time you are inclined to write very  your editor will delete it and the writing will be just as it should be .

ENFP	i have made it a rule never to smoke more that one cigar at a time .
ESTP	man will occasionally stumble over the truth , but most of the time he will pick himself up and continue on .
ESFP	everything that happens once can never happen again . but everything that happens twice will surely happen a third time .
ESTP	one does not leave a convivial party before closing time .
ESTP	no idea is so outlandish that it should not be considered with a searching but at the same time a steady eye .
ENTP	the time you enjoy wasting is not wasted time .
INFP	i wasted time , and now doth time waste me .
INFP	if you can look into the seeds of time , and say which grain will grow and which will not , speak then unto me .
INFP	time and the hour run through the roughest day .
ESFP	the time to repair the roof is when the sun is shining .
ENFJ	do the one thing you think you can not do . fail at it . try again . do better the second time . the only people who never tumble are those who never mount the high wire . this is your moment . own it .
ESFP	no matter what time it is , wake me , even if it s in the middle of a cabinet meeting .
ENTP	leisure is the time for doing something useful . this leisure the diligent person will obtain the lazy one never .

ESFP	we must use time as a tool , not as a couch .
ENTP	employ thy time well , if thou meanest to gain leisure .
ISFP	i have been on a calendar , but i have never been on time .
ENTJ	we praise a man who feels angry on the right grounds and against the right persons and also in the right manner at the right moment and for the right length of time .
ENTJ	for one swallow does not make a summer , nor does one day and so too one day , or a short time , does not make a man blessed and happy .
INTJ	glance into the world just as though time were gone : and everything crooked will become straight to you .
ISTP	i went to a restaurant that serves breakfast at any time  . so i ordered french toast during the renaissance .
ISTP	you ca not just ask customers what they want and then try to give that to them . by the time you get it built , they will want something new .
ENTJ	whether if soul did not exist time would exist or not , is a question that may fairly be asked for if there can not be someone to count there can not be anything that can be counted , so that evidently there can not be number for number is either what has been , or what can be , counted .
ENTJ	if you just set out to be liked , you would be prepared to compromise on anything at any time , and you would achieve nothing .
ISFP	for a long time i was scared i d find out i was like my mother .
ISFP	consider the fellow . he never spends his time telling you about his previous night s date . you get the idea he has eyes only for you and would not think of looking at another woman .
ISFP	anything i have ever said , i certainly was feeling at the time .
ISFP	well , i am working all the time to stay out of trouble !
ESTP	if you treat people right they will treat you right ... ninety percent of the time .
INTJ	people wo not have time for you if you are always angry or complaining .
ENFP	i think people should be allowed to do anything they want . we have not tried that for a while . maybe this time it will work .
ESFP	once you have mastered time , you will understand how true it is that most people overestimate what they can accomplish in a year - and underestimate what they can achieve in a decade !
ISFJ	how much time he saves who does not look to see what his neighbor says or does or thinks .
ESTJ	most people spend more time and energy going around problems than in trying to solve them .

INTP	as people are walking all the time , in the same spot , a path appears .
ESTP	instead of worrying about what people say of you , why not spend time trying to accomplish something they will admire .
ESFP	live one day at a time emphasizing ethics rather than rules .
ENTJ	acting is a nice childish profession - pretending you are someone else and , at the same time , selling yourself .
ISFP	we have time , there s no big rush .
INTP	the senses deceive from time to time , and it is prudent never to trust wholly those who have deceived us even once .
ESTP	his talent was as natural as the pattern that was made by the dust on a butterfly s wings . at one time he understood it no more than the butterfly did and he did not know when it was brushed or marred .
ENFJ	i really wanted to retire and rest and spend more time with my children , my grandchildren and of course with my wife .
ISFJ	time is a sort of river of passing events , and strong is its current no sooner is a thing brought to sight than it is swept by and another takes its place , and this too will be swept away .
ESFP	the first time that i performed as an actor was the first day on the set of the fresh prince of bel-air .

ISTJ	civilization began the first time an angry person cast a word instead of a rock .
ENTP	we have protected thousands of people in libya we have not seen a single u.s. casualty there s no risks of additional escalation . this operation is limited in time and in scope .
ISTJ	we always live in an uncertain world . what is certain is that the united states will go forward over time .
ENTP	we need to internalize this idea of excellence . not many folks spend a lot of time trying to be excellent .
ESTJ	it has been my observation that most people get ahead during the time that others waste .
ESTP	ezra was right half the time , and when he was wrong , he was so wrong you were never in any doubt about it .
INFP	i can only note that the past is beautiful because one never realises an emotion at the time . it expands later , and thus we do not have complete emotions about the present , only about the past .
ENTJ	if you set out to be liked , you would be prepared to compromise on anything at any time , and you would achieve nothing .
ENTP	people of berlin - people of the world - this is our moment . this is our time .
ENTP	we all knew this . we all knew that it would take more time than any of us want to dig ourselves out of this hole created by this economic crisis .

ISTP	i put instant coffee in a microwave oven and almost went back in time .
ENTP	perfection is attained by slow degrees it requires the hand of time .
ISTP	i like mitt romney as a person . i think he s a dignified person . but i have no common ground on economics . he does not worry about the federal reserve . he does not worry about foreign policy . he does not talk about civil liberties , so i would have a hard time to expect him to ever invite me to campaign with him .
ISTP	and i think it s that time . and i think if you just step aside and mr. romney can kind of take over . you can maybe still use a plane . though maybe a smaller one . not that big gas guzzler you are going around to colleges and talking about student loans and stuff like that .
INFP	there is not enough time to do all the nothing we want to do .
ENTJ	i spend a lot of time reading .
ISTJ	you know , people talk about this being an uncertain time . you know , all time is uncertain . i mean , it was uncertain back in - in 2007 , we just did not know it was uncertain . it was - uncertain on september 10th , 2001 . it was uncertain on october 18th , 1987 , you just did not know it .
ISFP	well , especially now i come to realize - and then - i would do my schooling which was three hours with a tutor and right after that i would go to the recording studio and record , and i d record for hours and hours until it s time to go to sleep .
ISTJ	time is the friend of the wonderful company , the enemy of the mediocre .
ENTJ	it pays to know the enemy - not least because at some time you may have the opportunity to turn him into a friend .
ENFP	words , words , words ! they shut one off from the universe . three quarters of the time one s never in contact with things , only with the beastly words that stand for them .
ISFJ	mr. president , you were elected to lead . you chose to follow . and now it s time for you to get out of the way .
ISFJ	instead of leading the world by how much we borrow , it s time that we make sure we lead the world in how much we build and create and invest .
ISFJ	i went to massachusetts to make a difference . i did not go there to begin a political career running time and time again . i made a difference . i put in place the things i wanted to do .
ISFJ	it s time for the party of big ideas , not the party of big brother !
ISTP	in time it will become clear to everyone that support for the policies of pre-emptive war and interventionist nation-building will have much greater significance than the removal of saddam hussein itself .
ISTP	right now i am having amnesia and deja vu at the same time .
ENTJ	take time to deliberate , but when the time for action has arrived , stop thinking and go in .

ISTP	i keep working because i learn something new all the time .
ISFJ	at a time when nobody thought we d ever see a new steel mill built in america , we took a chance and built one in a corn field in indiana . today steel dynamics is one of the largest steel producers in the united states .
ISTP	i bought some instant water one time but i did not know what to add to it .
INFP	the time for action is now . it s never too late to do something .
INTJ	if we do discover a complete theory , it should be in time understandable in broad principle by everyone . then we shall all , philosophers , scientists , and just ordinary people be able to take part in the discussion of why we and the universe exist .
ISTP	as recent as the year 2000 we won elections by saying we should not be the policemen of the world , and that we should not be nation building . and its time we got those values back into this country .
ISTP	i saw a bank that said 24 hour banking ,  but i do not have that much time .
ESTP	it takes a long time to bring the past up to the present .
ENTJ	it s life is not it ? you plow ahead and make a hit . and you plow on and someone passes you . then someone passes them . time levels .
ISTJ	the only time to buy these is on a day with no y  in it .
ENTJ	digital reading will completely take over . it s lightweight and it s fantastic for sharing . over time it will take over .
ENTJ	oh , i think there are a lot of people who would be buying and selling online today that go up there and they get the information , but then when it comes time to type in their credit card they think twice because they are not sure about how that might get out and what that might mean for them .
ENTJ	i think the thing we see is that as people are using video games more , they tend to watch passive tv a bit less . and so using the pc for the internet , playing video games , is starting to cut into the rather unbelievable amount of time people spend watching tv .
ESTP	do your damnedest in an ostentatious manner all the time .
ESFP	i have done everything i wanted to do , even if i have had to pay a very high price - which has been the case most of the time .
ESTP	i like to hide behind the characters i play . despite the public perception , i am a very private person who has a hard time with the fame thing .
ISFP	i think i am finally growing up - and about time .
ESTJ	my two secrets to staying healthy : wash your hands all the time . and , if you ca not , use purell or one of the sanitizers . and the other is hot peppers . i eat a lot of hot peppers . i for some reason started doing that in 1992 , and i swear by it .
ENFP	what with making their way and enjoying what they have won , heroes have no time to think . but the sons of heroes - ah , they have all the necessary leisure .
ENTJ	no woman in my time will be prime minister or chancellor or foreign secretary - not the top jobs . anyway , i would not want to be prime minister you have to give yourself 100 percent .
ISFJ	i do not even drink ! i ca not stand the taste of alcohol . every new year s eve i try one drink and every time it makes me feel sick . so i do not touch booze - i am always the designated driver .
INFP	in our time political speech and writing are largely the defense of the indefensible .
ENTJ	there comes a time when deceit and defiance must be seen for what they are . at that point , a gathering danger must be directly confronted . at that point , we must show that beyond our resolutions is actual resolve .
ESTJ	the time has come for all evangelists to practice full financial disclosure . the world is watching how we walk and how we talk . we must have the highest standards of morality , ethics and integrity if we are to continue to have influence .
ENTP	a truer image of the world , i think , is obtained by picturing things as entering into the stream of time from an eternal world outside , than from a view which regards time as the devouring tyrant of all that is .
INFP	in seed time learn , in harvest teach , in winter enjoy .
ISTP	most of the time i do not have much fun . the rest of the time i do not have any fun at all .
INTJ	we should not say that one man s hour is worth another man s hour , but rather that one man during an hour is worth just as much as another man during an hour . time is everything , man is nothing : he is at the most time s carcass .
ESTJ	i have spent too much time giving speeches , traveling the world .
ENFP	i must uphold my ideals , for perhaps the time will come when i shall be able to carry them out .
ESTJ	we know in new york we have several million at any one time who are in new york illegally .
ESTJ	i always supported the women i worked with having time off to go to parent-teacher conferences and doctors  appointments or bringing their infants into the office .
ESTJ	i am shocked at how much time i spend in the white house . i mean , you know , for people on the outside , the idea of going to the white house for a meeting must seem like the most important , serious , even glamorous kind of thing to do .
ESTJ	sometimes overturning brutal regimes takes time and costs lives . i wish it were not so . i really , really do .
INFP	the intellectual is different from the ordinary man , but only in certain sections of his personality , and even then not all the time .
INTJ	my favorite time in the cycles of public life is the time when the pope is dead and they have not elected a new one . there s no one in the world who is infallible for those weeks . and you know , i do not miss it .
INFP	eternity is in love with the productions of time .
ESFP	life gives you plenty of time to do whatever you want to do if you stay in the present moment .
ENTP	both in thought and in feeling , even though time be real , to realise the unimportance of time is the gate of wisdom .
INTP	for the first half of geological time our ancestors were bacteria . most creatures still are bacteria , and each one of our trillions of cells is a colony of bacteria .
ENFP	i live in a crazy time .
ISTJ	the most thought-provoking thing in our thought-provoking time is that we are still not thinking .

ESFP	i sacrifice in my love life and my social life , but those things will be there in three or four years . this is a really important time in my life . i ca not just be the girl who sang i kissed a girl .  i have to leave a legacy .
ISFP	in every battle there comes a time when both sides consider themselves beaten , then he who continues the attack wins .
ENTP	the person who grieves suffers his passion to grow upon him he indulges it , he loves it but this never happens in the case of actual pain , which no man ever willingly endured for any considerable time .
ESTP	if you look - look at - i mean , look at what s going on with your gasoline prices . they are going to go to $ 5 , $ 6 , $ 7 and we do not have anybody in washington that calls opec and says , fellas , it s time . it s over . you are not going to do it anymore . 
ISTP	you will launch many projects , but have time to finish only a few . so think , plan , develop , launch and tap good people to be responsible . give them authority and hold them accountable . trying to do too much yourself creates a bottleneck .
ESFJ	all my life , whenever it comes time to make a decision , i make it and forget about it .
ISTJ	time is not a thing , thus nothing which is , and yet it remains constant in its passing away without being something temporal like the beings in time .
ESFJ	my own time is passing fast enough without some national game to help it along .
ESTP	i suppose , in a way , this has become part of my soul . it is a symbol of my life . whatever i have done that really matters , i have done wearing it . when the time comes , it will be in this that i journey forth . what greater honor could come to an american , and a soldier ?
INFP	i do believe sometimes discipline is very important . i am not just lying around like a lazy cow all the time .
ENTJ	do not forget it s daylight savings time . you spring forward , then you fall back . it s like robert downey jr. getting out of bed .
ESTP	every time you walk down the street people are screaming , you are fired ! 
ISTJ	time goes on . so whatever you are going to do , do it . do it now . do not wait .
ENFP	and as a character , what i found very inspiring about playing dharma , especially at that time , is that the women on television were more neurotic than they were free . and i thought , this is a rare bird and this is unique on television and i think it s really refreshing .
ESFJ	i like ice hockey , but it s a frustrating game to watch . it s hard to keep your eyes on both the puck and the players and too much time passes between scoring in hockey . there are usually more fights than there are points .
ENTP	children are smarter than any of us . know how i know that ? i do not know one child with a full time job and children .
INFP	i do not read advertisements . i would spend all of my time wanting things .
ESFJ	a lot of people would be embarrassed to admit that they were on barney  , but i embrace the fact . i just had such a wonderful time doing that show . i learned what a camera and prop is , and all that . i learned my manners too , so i guess that s a good thing !
ESFJ	it s plain hokum . if you ca not convince em , confuse em . it s an old political trick . but this time it wo not work .
ENFP	what does it mean to pre-board ? do you get on before you get on ?
ENFP	we travel , some of us forever , to seek other states , other lives , other souls .
ENFP	to travel is to discover that everyone is wrong about other countries .
INFP	travelers repose and dream among my leaves .
INTJ	i love short trips to new york to me it is the finest three-day town on earth .
INFP	travelling expands the mind rarely .
ENFP	i never travel without my diary . one should always have something sensational to read in the train .
ESTP	writing and travel broaden your ass if not your mind and i like to write standing up .

ENTP	operations in iraq and afghanistan and the war on terrorism have reduced the pace of military transformation and have revealed our lack of preparation for defensive and stability operations . this administration has overextended our military .
ENTP	but do i think that our actions in anyway violate the war powers resolution , the answer is no .
ENTP	we are not going to baby sit a civil war .
ENTP	we are not at war against islam .
ISTJ	in most communities it is illegal to cry fire  in a crowded assembly . should it not be considered serious international misconduct to manufacture a general war scare in an effort to achieve local political aims ?
ESTP	more than an end to war , we want an end to the beginning of all wars - yes , an end to this brutal , inhuman and thoroughly impractical method of settling the differences between governments .
INFP	war against a foreign country only happens when the moneyed classes think they are going to profit from it .
ISTP	war is never economically beneficial except for those in position to profit from war expenditures .
ISTP	i was drafted during the korean war .
ISTP	think of what happened after 9/11 , the minute before there was any assessment , there was glee in the administration because now we can invade iraq , and so the war drums beat .
ESTP	war is a contagion .
ISTP	throughout the 20th century , the republican party benefited from a non-interventionist foreign policy . think of how eisenhower came in to stop the korean war . think of how nixon was elected to stop the mess in vietnam .
ISTP	what is not conservative about saying , do not go to war unless we go to war properly with a full declaration of war and no other way ? 
ISTP	there s nothing wrong with being a conservative and coming up with a conservative believe in foreign policy where we have a strong national defense and we do not go to war so carelessly .
INFP	serious sport is war minus the shooting .
INFP	there is hardly such a thing as a war in which it makes no difference who wins . nearly always one side stands more of less for progress , the other side more or less for reaction .
ESTJ	we should invade their countries , kill their leaders and convert them to christianity . we were not punctilious about locating and punishing only hitler and his top officers . we carpet-bombed german cities we killed civilians . that s war . and this is war .
INFP	war is a way of shattering to pieces ... materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable and ... too intelligent .
INFP	oceania was at war with eurasia therefore oceania had always been at war with eurasia .

ISFJ	this war is not about slavery .
ESTP	in war there is no substitute for victory .
INFJ	all oppression creates a state of war .
INTJ	dalton s records , carefully preserved for a century , were destroyed during the world war ii bombing of manchester . it is not only the living who are killed in war .
INTJ	it is not only the living who are killed in war .
INTP	of all the enemies of public liberty , war is perhaps the most to be dreaded , because it comprises and develops the germ of every other .
INTP	even philosophers will praise war as ennobling mankind , forgetting the greek who said : war is bad in that it begets more evil than it kills . 
ISFJ	it is good that war is so horrible , or we might grow to like it .
ISFJ	the war ... was an unnecessary condition of affairs , and might have been avoided if forebearance and wisdom had been practiced on both sides .
INTJ	total war is no longer war waged by all members of one national community against all those of another . it is total ... because it may well involve the whole world .
INTP	the executive has no right , in any case , to decide the question , whether there is or is not cause for declaring war .
ESTP	in war , you win or lose , live or die - and the difference is just an eyelash .
INFJ	wanton killing of innocent civilians is terrorism , not a war against terrorism .
INFP	my songs are my kids . some of them stay with me , some others i have to send out , out to the war . it might sound stupid and it might even sound naive , but that s just the way it is .
INFP	the connection between dress and war is not far to seek your finest clothes are those you wear as soldiers .
ENTJ	in war , events of importance are the result of trivial causes .
INFJ	nowadays it is the fashion to emphasize the horrors of the last war . i did not find it so horrible . there are just as horrible things happening all round us today , if only we had eyes to see them .
ESTP	this administration here and now declares unconditional war on poverty .
ESTP	i am tired . i am tired of feeling rejected by the american people . i am tired of waking up in the middle of the night worrying about the war .
INTP	war contains so much folly , as well as wickedness , that much is to be hoped from the progress of reason .
INFP	this is an important book , the critic assumes , because it deals with war . this is an insignificant book because it deals with the feelings of women in a drawing-room .
INTJ	i love it when muslims go to war with each other , as i do when the christians do , because it shows there s no such thing as the christian world and the islamic world . that s all crap .
ENTJ	it is barack obama who is at war with this country . recent events prove it . this is not a cliche . it s not a figure of speech . obama is at war with the u.s. economy .
ENFP	all this happened , more or less . the war parts , anyway , are pretty much true .
ISTJ	the condition of man ... is a condition of war of everyone against everyone .
ESTP	the terrorists and their supporters declared war on the united states - and war is what they got .
INFP	virtue is a state of war , and to live in it we have always to combat with ourselves .
ESTP	some have argued that confronting the threat from iraq could detract from the war against terror . to the contrary , confronting the threat posed by iraq is crucial to winning the war on terror .
ESTP	this was not an act of terrorism , but it was an act of war .
ESTP	with those attacks , the terrorists and their supporters declared war on the united states . and war is what they got .
ESFP	for one thing , i do not think that anybody in any war thinks of themselves as a hero .
INFJ	we can , for example , be fairly confident that either there will be a world without war or there wo not be a world - at least , a world inhabited by creatures other than bacteria and beetles , with some scattering of others .
ESTP	war is a blessing compared with national degradation .
ESTP	what is more immoral than war ?
ESFP	i interviewed survivors , i went to poland , saw the cities and spent time with the people and spoke to the jews who had come back to poland after the war and talked about why they had come back .
ESFP	when war comes , two things happen - profits go way , way up and all perishables go way , way down . there becomes a market for them .
ESFP	in the re-creation of combat situations , and this is coming from a director who s never been in one , being mindful of what these veterans have actually gone through , you find that the biggest concern is that you do not look at war as a geopolitical endeavor .
ENTP	as for charity , it is a matter in which the immediate effect on the persons directly concerned , and the ultimate consequence to the general good , are apt to be at complete war with one another .
ESFJ	australians are coffee snobs . an influx of italian immigrants after world war ii ensured that - we probably had the word cappuccino  about 20 years before america . cafe culture is really big for aussies . we like to work hard , but we take our leisure time seriously .
ESTP	this is not johnson s war . this is america s war . if i drop dead tomorrow , this war will still be with you .
INTJ	i do not think the war in afghanistan was ruthlessly enough waged .
INTJ	a faction willing to take the risks of making war on the ossified status quo in the middle east can be described as many things , but not as conservative .
INTJ	there are people who can not forget , as neither do i , the lesson of the years of the indochina war . which was , first , that the state is capable of being a murderer . a mass murderer , and a conspirator and a liar .
ESTP	nullification means insurrection and war and the other states have a right to put it down .
ISTP	i want a world without war , a world without insanity . i want to see people do well . i do not even think it s as much as what i want for myself . it s more what i want for the people around me . that s what i want .
ISFJ	there s no doubt that usually a president s public image is enhanced by going to war . that never did appeal to me .
ISFJ	i had very good support from democrats and republicans all throughout my administration . i had a very high batting average . we added more jobs per year in my four years than any other president since the second world war .
ISFP	if men make war in slavish obedience to rules , they will fail .
ENFJ	war is organized murder and torture against our brothers .
ENTJ	i was a little girl in world war ii and i am used to being freed by americans .
ENTJ	the u.n. bureaucracy has grown to elephantine proportions . now that the cold war is over , we are asking that elephant to do gymnastics .
ENTJ	i saw what happened when a dictator was allowed to take over a piece of a country and the country went down the tubes . and i saw the opposite during the war when america joined the fight .
ENTP	i had nearly finished school because i was making effort not that bad on that . but there was a law in germany after the war . you could not make your final examination before 18 , so lots of people who were late because of the way had to do it first .
ENFJ	mine is the first generation able to contemplate the possibility that we may live our entire lives without going to war or sending our children to war .
ENFJ	to all those who walk the path of human cooperation war must appear loathsome and inhuman .
INFP	for what can war , but endless war , still breed ?

ISTJ	force and fraud are in war the two cardinal virtues .
ESFP	i am a lad of the 60s . i started a magazine to try and end the vietnam war , but it was a number of years before i had the profile , the financial resources and the time to do more .
ENFJ	in april 1991 , after the gulf war , iraq was given 15 days to provide a full and final declaration of all its wmd .
ISTP	i ca not go to war with paparazzi .
ESFP	everybody has a job to do . there are people in iraq on both sides of this war who do what they do for religious reasons , and they feel with god on their side . some people are good at annihilating people . maybe that s their gift .
ESFJ	new terms used like , overseas contingency operation  instead of the word war  - that reflects a worldview that is out of touch with the enemy that we face . we ca not spin our way out of this threat .
ESFJ	despite what the pundits want us to think , contested primaries are not civil war , they are democracy at work , and that s beautiful .
ESTJ	we are at war , and our security as a nation depends on winning that war .
ISFP	i have a friend that is a wwii buff , and we sat and talked a lot about stuff like the war and the reasons behind it , and you now it s all in the uniform . once you are in it , it usually does all the work for you .
ISTJ	war consisteth not in battle only , or the act of fighting but in a tract of time , wherein the will to contend by battle is sufficiently known .
ENTJ	conservatives saw the savagery of 9/11 in the attacks and prepared for war liberals saw the savagery of the 9/11 attacks and wanted to prepare indictments and offer therapy and understanding for our attackers .
ENTJ	winston churchill aroused this nation in heroic fashion to save civilisation in world war two . we have everything we need except political will , but political will is a renewable resource .
ENFJ	a majority of this country opposes this war , a majority of this country never voted for this administration .
ENTJ	i have absolutely no regret about my vote against this war . the same questions remain . the cost in human lives , the cost to our budget , probably 100 billion . we could have probably brought down that statue for a lot less .
ISTP	people like to make fun of the fans who camp out but people have renaissance fairs people do civil war re-enactments people do what they like . i am tired of hearing people rage on the fans . if you do not like twilight ,  do not buy a ticket .
INTP	the cold war was over long before it was officially declared dead .
INTP	during the cold war , we lived in coded times when it was not easy and there were shades of grey and ambiguity .
INTP	in every war zone that i have been in , there has been a reality and then there has been the public perception of why the war was being fought . in every crisis , the issues have been far more complex than the public has been allowed to know .
INTP	i worked for mi6 in the sixties , during the great witch-hunts , when the shared paranoia of the cold war gripped the services .
ENTJ	i think the record speaks for itself . these are two individuals who have been for the war when the headlines were good and against it when their poll ratings were bad .
ENTJ	it s very important to go back and keep in mind the distinction between handling these events as criminal acts , which was the way we did before 9/11 , and then looking at 9/11 and saying , this is not a criminal act ,  not when you destroy 16 acres of manhattan , kill 3,000 americans , blow a big hole in the pentagon . that s an act of war .
ENTJ	from our perspective , trying to deal with this continuing campaign of terror , if you will , the war on terror that we are engaged in , this is a continuing enterprise . the people that were involved in some of those activities before 9/11 are still out there .
ESTJ	it s never acceptable to target civilians . it violates the geneva accords , it violates the international law of war and it violates all principles of morality .
ESFP	i mean , i was born the day war broke out , but i do not remember all the bombs though they did actually break up liverpool , you know . i remember when i was a little older , there was big gaps in all the streets where houses used to be . we used to play over them .
ISFP	i have always been at war with myself , for right or wrong .
ENTJ	the fact is , bush s war policy has failed . it s failed ! who better to say so than jack murtha ?
INFP	when i was in pulp , i actively did more tv stuff because that was during the great britpop wars , and it seemed important to prove that indie people could speak . that war does not exist anymore .
ENFJ	we live in the time where we have fictitious election results that elects a fictitious president . we live in a time where we have a man sending us to war for fictitious reasons .
ENFP	i feel like war should occur only for the most vital and necessary reasons , and only then .
INTJ	the chain of wedlock is so heavy that it takes two to carry it - and sometimes three .
ISFP	i d imagine my wedding as a fairy tale ... huge , beautiful and white .
ENFP	i remember when i was in school , they would ask , what are you going to be when you grow up ?  and then you d have to draw a picture of it . i drew a picture of myself as a bride .
ISFJ	i think that weddings have probably been crashed since the beginning of time . cavemen crashed them . you go to meet girls . it makes sense .
ISFJ	the wedding march has a bit of a death march in it .
ISFJ	i have always been the type to fall in love fast and , with every boyfriend , i plan out my wedding in my head .
ISFP	we were pretty good mates until the beatles started to split up and yoko came into it . it was more like old army buddies splitting up on account of wedding bells .
ENFP	one tradition i have with my friends is that when one of us gets married , we have a ton of fragrance oils and pretty bottles at the bachelorette party . everyone puts a drop or two in a bottle for the bride and makes a wish , and the bride wears our creation on her wedding day .
INFP	a man s got two shots for jewelry : a wedding ring and a watch . the watch is a lot easier to get on and off than a wedding ring .
ISFJ	i do not ever really feel that wearing my wedding ring is what determines me being married or not .
ISFJ	i have never crashed a wedding . when i was a kid i , of course , used to crash parties . crashing a wedding is difficult though because you have to have the suit , and you have to have information in case someone catches you . you have to know at least some names and something .
ISFJ	i try to remember , as i hear about friends getting engaged , that it s not about the ring and it s not about the wedding . it s a grave thing , getting married . and it s easy to get swept up in the wrong things .
ESFJ	i am usually part of any disaster at a wedding if i am a bridesmaid , which i have been lucky enough to be several times .
ENTP	we all went to kelsey s wedding , and yeah , we go to parties . we also go to each other s house . a group of us got together over at kelsey s and just read through some plays just for the fun of it . that may not be everyone s idea of a good time , but we had a good time .
ESTJ	i always envisioned myself having a traditional and elegant wedding .
ENFJ	if you talk to a man in a language he understands , that goes to his head . if you talk to him in his language , that goes to his heart .
INFJ	honesty is the first chapter in the book of wisdom .
INTP	reality is merely an illusion , albeit a very persistent one .
ESFP	when written in chinese , the word crisis  is composed of two characters . one represents danger and the other represents opportunity .
ESTJ	obstacles are those frightful things you see when you take your eyes off your goal .
ENFJ	turn your wounds into wisdom .
ENTP	the doors of wisdom are never shut .
INTJ	does wisdom perhaps appear on the earth as a raven which is inspired by the smell of carrion ?
ESTP	never tell people how to do things . tell them what to do and they will surprise you with their ingenuity .
ESTP	it has long been an axiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important .
INFP	the road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom .
ENTJ	the truest wisdom is a resolute determination .
INTJ	start wide , expand further , and never look back .
INFJ	it is unwise to be too sure of one s own wisdom . it is healthy to be reminded that the strongest might weaken and the wisest might err .
ENTJ	excellence , then , is a state concerned with choice , lying in a mean , relative to us , this being determined by reason and in the way in which the man of practical wisdom would determine it .
ENTJ	the virtue of justice consists in moderation , as regulated by wisdom .
INTJ	there is more wisdom in your body than in your deepest philosophy .
ENFJ	follow your instincts . that s where true wisdom manifests itself .
ENTP	no party has a monopoly on wisdom . no democracy works without compromise . but when governor romney and his allies in congress tell us we can somehow lower our deficit by spending trillions more on new tax breaks for the wealthy - well , you do the math . i refuse to go along with that . and as long as i am president , i never will .
ENTP	but what is liberty without wisdom , and without virtue ? it is the greatest of all possible evils for it is folly , vice , and madness , without tuition or restraint .
ISTJ	the older i get the more wisdom i find in the ancient rule of taking first things first . a process which often reduces the most complex human problem to a manageable proportion .
ESTJ	i learned some valuable lessons about the legislative process , the importance of bipartisan cooperation and the wisdom of taking small steps to get a big job done .
ISFJ	we must expect reverses , even defeats . they are sent to teach us wisdom and prudence , to call forth greater energies , and to prevent our falling into greater disasters .
INFP	the hours of folly are measured by the clock but of wisdom , no clock can measure .
ENTJ	enraging liberals is simply one of the more enjoyable side effects of my wisdom .
INFP	what wisdom can you find that is greater than kindness ?
INTP	every nation whose affairs betray a want of wisdom and stability may calculate on every loss which can be sustained from the more systematic policy of its wiser neighbors .
ESFP	in my definition of consciousness , consciousness is the same thing as life . what wisdom traditions also call spirit .
ISTJ	it is not wisdom but authority that makes a law .
ESFJ	the word philosophy sounds high-minded , but it simply means the love of wisdom . if you love something , you do not just read about it you hug it , you mess with it , you play with it , you argue with it .
INFJ	it seems to me that , in every culture , i come across a chapter headed wisdom .  and then i know exactly what is going to follow : vanity of vanities , all is vanity . 
ENTJ	the plan was criticized by some retired military officers embedded in tv studios . but with every advance by our coalition forces , the wisdom of that plan becomes more apparent .
ENFJ	surely , god on high has not refused to give us enough wisdom to find ways to bring us an improvement in relations between the two great nations on earth .
ENFP	mainstream media tend to just mouth the conventional wisdom , to see everything through the filter of right and left .
ISFP	i do not know who invented high heels , but all women owe him a lot .
INTJ	ah , women . they make the highs higher and the lows more frequent .
ESTP	i always play women i would date .
ENTJ	i never realized until lately that women were supposed to be the inferior sex .
ENTJ	i owe nothing to women s lib .
INTP	single women have a dreadful propensity for being poor . which is one very strong argument in favor of matrimony .
ESTP	women are naturally secretive , and they like to do their own secreting .
ENTJ	i think today women are very scared to celebrate themselves , because then they just get labeled .
ESFP	what we women need to do , instead of worrying about what we do not have , is just love what we do have .
ENTJ	it s incredibly unfair . you do not see a lot of 60-year-old women with 20-year-old men onscreen .
ENTP	women are frightening . if you get to 41 as a man , you are quite battle-scarred .
ENFJ	the no . 1 impediment to women succeeding in the workforce is now in the home .
ENFP	women are made to be loved , not understood .
ENFP	all women become like their mothers . that is their tragedy . no man does . that s his .
ISFP	i do not hate women - they just sometimes make me mad .
INTJ	women are considered deep - why ? because one can never discover any bottom to them . women are not even shallow .
ENTJ	women are nothing but machines for producing children .
INTJ	behind all their personal vanity , women themselves always have an impersonal contempt for woman .
ISFP	i have always had a talent for irritating women since i was fourteen .

INTJ	women . they are a complete mystery .
INTJ	if i became a philosopher , if i have so keenly sought this fame for which i am still waiting , it s all been to seduce women basically .
ENFP	if women ran the world we would not have wars , just intense negotiations every 28 days .
ESTP	i seem to be getting a lot of things pushed my way that are strong women . it s like people see hackers and they send me offers to play tough women with guns , the kind who wear no bra and a little tank top . i d like to play strong women who are also very feminine .
ESTJ	if a country does not recognize minority rights and human rights , including women s rights , you will not have the kind of stability and prosperity that is possible .
ESTJ	women are the largest untapped reservoir of talent in the world .
INFJ	no one is more arrogant toward women , more aggressive or scornful , than the man who is anxious about his virility .
ESTJ	human rights are women s rights , and women s rights are human rights .
ESTJ	i fought all my life for women to make their own choices , in their personal and professional lives . i made mine .
ESTJ	wealthy women have rights in every country . and poor women do not .
ESTJ	a psychologist once told me that for a boy being in the middle of a conflict between two women is the worst possible situation . there s always a desire to please each one .
ESTP	all of the women on the apprentice flirted with me - consciously or unconsciously . that s to be expected .
ENTP	what democratic congressmen do to their women staffers , republican congressmen do to the country .
INTJ	women are the engine driving the growth in california s economy . women make california s economy unique .
INTP	good-humoured , unaffected girls , will not do for a man who has been used to sensible women . they are two distinct orders of being .
ENTJ	feminism was established to allow unattractive women easier access to the mainstream .
INTP	there are certainly not so many men of large fortune in the world , as there are pretty women to deserve them .
ESTP	the men and women of afghanistan are building a nation that is free , and proud , and fighting terror - and america is honored to be their friend .
ESFJ	black women have always been these vixens , these animalistic erotic women . why ca not we just be the sexy american girl next door ?
ENTP	and i highly recommend for all the women in the world , even if they are 71 , you can never take for granted that he loves you . it s always good to flirt with him . it s a great sport .
ENFP	i have been trying to find women writers for my staff for a while now and i have three women on my staff and three guys so it s pretty equal . i do not know why that is . it s been the same thing for a while . it s hard for female comedians to stand out . that s weird . that s a shame .
ENFP	comedy can be , especially in a writer s room , really aggressive , kind of a very male-dominated room , and it would be hard for women . it s not a nurturing place . it s not like a lot of women are going to say , i ca not wait to live that lifestyle and be in a writer s room until 2 or 3 a.m .
ISFJ	i remember when the wave of jennifer lopez , salma hayek and these beautiful hispanic women came into light , and i looked up to them and i loved them , but i was like , where are middle eastern women ? 
ESTP	america is a friend to the people of iraq . our demands are directed only at the regime that enslaves them and threatens us . when these demands are met , the first and greatest benefit will come to iraqi men , women and children .
ESFJ	black women do not have the same body image problems as white women . they are proud of their bodies .
ENFP	there s very little advice in men s magazines , because men do not think there s a lot they do not know . women do . women want to learn . men think , i know what i am doing , just show me somebody naked . 
ENTP	women priests . great , great . now there s priests of both sexes i do not listen to .
ESTJ	when i get up and work out , i am working out just as much for my girls as i am for me , because i want them to see a mother who loves them dearly , who invests in them , but who also invests in herself . it s just as much about letting them know as young women that it is okay to put yourself a little higher on your priority list .
INFJ	make women rational creatures , and free citizens , and they will quickly become good wives - that is , if men do not neglect the duties of husbands and fathers .
INFJ	the most mediocre of males feels himself a demigod as compared with women .
ESTP	i want to make a policy statement . i am unabashedly in favor of women .
INTJ	i am not particularly a feminist , but if you get women off the animal cycle of reproduction and give them some say in how many children they will have , immediately the floor will rise .
INFP	reading , solitude , idleness , a soft and sedentary life , intercourse with women and young people , these are perilous paths for a young man , and these lead him constantly into danger .
ENFP	women should stop going for the bad guys , stop looking so far when the good ones are right there .
ISTP	imagine , a september 11 with weapons of mass destruction . it s not 3,000 . it s tens of thousands of innocent men , women and children .
ENFJ	for any of us in this room today , let s start out by admitting we are lucky . we do not live in the world our mothers lived in , our grandmothers lived in , where career choices for women were so limited .
ENFP	men want to make women happy .
ENTJ	i have never wanted to look like models on the cover of magazines . i represent the majority of women and i am very proud of that .

ENFP	i support women , men , anybody who is in a place that s not their strongest and who is ready to push forward .
ENFP	i do not know why women feel an affinity with me .
ISFP	growing up with the childhood that i had , i learned to never let a man make me feel helpless , and it also embedded a deep need in me to always stick up for women .
ENTJ	i think women are really good at making friends and not good at networking . men are good at networking and not necessarily making friends . that s a gross generalization , but i think it holds in many ways .
ENTJ	i have said this many times , that there seems to be enough room in the world for mediocre men , but not for mediocre women , and we really have to work very , very hard .
ESTP	to be outspoken , or different at all , is a problem for women .
ISFP	people love talking about when they were young and heard honky tonk women for the first time . it s quite a heavy load to carry on your shoulders , the memories of so many people .
INFP	i do not mind a dirty girl . but what i find tragic is when we , as women , become not the subject of our own story but someone else s object .
ENTJ	women have to be active listeners and interrupters - but when you interrupt , you have to know what you are talking about .
ISFJ	my decision to register women confirms what is already obvious throughout our society-that women are now providing all types of skills in every profession . the military should be no exception .
ESTJ	if we took away women s right to vote , we d never have to worry about another democrat president .
ENTP	i noticed in the past , a lot of guys who like strong women , they really freak out if you are not strong 24/7 . or they complain about you being strong , then the moment you are not strong , they are like , oh , no , no , no . 
ISFP	i think all of us as women have this super-human quality . we create life , we give life , we are the sources of life for our children - we are all pretty bionic .
ISFP	i definitely love women . they are more attractive to the naked eye .
ESFJ	my favorite play in drama school was the bacchae .  it s about a king who literally gets eaten alive by all the women in the play in a kind of orgy - it s related to the word bacchanal  - and i loved that idea of animalistic chaos and following our own desires .
INFP	the violence betwen women is unbelievable . women try to make each other crawl so that their knees are bleeding .
INFP	my father has a pragmatic mind . he marched with dr. king in the 60s , and he s very much for women s rights .
