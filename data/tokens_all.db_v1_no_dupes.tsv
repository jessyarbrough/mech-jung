INTP	Common sense is the collection of prejudices acquired by age eighteen .
INTP	Reading , after a certain age , diverts the mind too much from its creative pursuits . Any man who reads too much and uses his own brain too little falls into lazy habits of thinking .
INTP	Confusion of goals and perfection of means seems , in my opinion , to characterize our age .
INTP	Perfection of means and confusion of ends seem to characterize our age .
ENFP	Life would be infinitely happier if we could only be born at the age of eighty and gradually approach eighteen .
INTJ	When marrying , ask yourself this question : Do you believe that you will be able to converse well with this person into your old age ? Everything else in marriage is transitory .
INFJ	As human beings , our greatness lies not so much in being able to remake the world - that is the myth of the atomic age - as in being able to remake ourselves .
INFP	A man loves the meat in his youth that he can not endure in his age .
INFJ	In every country and every age , the priest had been hostile to Liberty .
INFP	The golden age is before us , not behind us .
INFJ	Every formula of every religion has in this age of reason , to submit to the acid test of reason and universal assent .
ESFP	Thomas Jefferson once said , 'We should never judge a president by his age , only by his works . ' And ever since he told me that , I stopped worrying .
ENFP	No woman should ever be quite accurate about her age . It looks so calculating .
ENTP	At twenty years of age the will reigns at thirty , the wit and at forty , the judgment .
ENFP	Age does not protect you from love . But love , to some extent , protects you from age .
ESFP	Information is the oxygen of the modern age . It seeps through the walls topped by barbed wire , it wafts across the electrified borders .
ESFP	We prefer world law in the age of self-determination to world war in the age of mass extermination .
ENTJ	Education is the best provision for old age .
ISFP	Sometimes I think it would be easier to avoid old age , to die young , but then you 'd never complete your life , would you ? You 'd never wholly know you .
ENFJ	I do n't think of myself as a poor deprived ghetto girl who made good . I think of myself as somebody who from an early age knew I was responsible for myself , and I had to make good .
ISFP	The kids are old enough now - I just want to let them be kids . I do n't want to comment on them too much . They 're at an age where I just want to let them be kids .
ENFJ	Why should society feel responsible only for the education of children , and not for the education of all adults of every age ?
ESTP	Hesitation increases in relation to risk in equal proportion to age .
ENFJ	Books were my pass to personal freedom . I learned to read at age three , and soon discovered there was a whole world to conquer that went beyond our farm in Mississippi .
INFP	In our age there is no such thing as 'keeping out of politics . ' All issues are political issues , and politics itself is a mass of lies , evasions , folly , hatred and schizophrenia .
ENFP	The secret of genius is to carry the spirit of the child into old age , which mean never losing your enthusiasm .
ESFP	We are n't in an information age , we are in an entertainment age .

ISTP	I think being able to age gracefully is a very important talent . It is too late for me .
ESTP	Age wrinkles the body . Quitting wrinkles the soul .
ENTP	I do n't need you to remind me of my age . I have a bladder to do that for me .
ESTP	Men of age object too much , consult too long , adventure too little , repent too soon , and seldom drive business home to the full period , but content themselves with a mediocrity of success .
ENTJ	Dressing up is a bore . At a certain age , you decorate yourself to attract the opposite sex , and at a certain age , I did that . But I 'm past that age .
ISTP	How young can you die of old age ?
ISTJ	If youth knew if age could .
ISFP	I think the biggest disease the world suffers from in this day and age is the disease of people feeling unloved . I know that I can give love for a minute , for half an hour , for a day , for a month , but I can give . I am very happy to do that , I want to do that .
ENFP	The charm of history and its enigmatic lesson consist in the fact that , from age to age , nothing changes and yet everything is completely different .
ISFP	I created Punk for this day and age . Do you see Britney walking around wearing ties and singing punk ? Hell no . That 's what I do . I 'm like a Sid Vicious for a new generation .
ENFP	We are all geniuses up to the age of ten .
INTJ	Every age has its own poetry in every age the circumstances of history choose a nation , a race , a class to take up the torch by creating situations that can be expressed or transcended only through poetry .

ESFP	Publishing is in a kind of Jurassic age .
ENTP	To teach how to live without certainty and yet without being paralysed by hesitation is perhaps the chief thing that philosophy , in our age , can do for those who study it .
ENTP	It is possible that mankind is on the threshold of a golden age but , if so , it will be necessary first to slay the dragon that guards the door , and this dragon is religion .
ENTJ	Nobody expects to trust his body overmuch after the age of fifty .
ESTJ	I have the problems of , I must confess , old age .
ESFJ	Bad news is n't wine . It does n't improve with age .
INFP	Not to expose your true feelings to an adult seems to be instinctive from the age of seven or eight onwards .
ENTP	Admiration of the proletariat , like that of dams , power stations , and aeroplanes , is part of the ideology of the machine age .
ENTP	But the age of chivalry is gone . That of sophisters , economists , and calculators has succeeded and the glory of Europe is extinguished forever .
INTJ	The ruling ideas of each age have ever been the ideas of its ruling class .
ENTP	The arrogance of age must submit to be taught by youth .
ISFP	The biggest disease this day and age is that of people feeling unloved .
ISTJ	Few women , I fear , have had such reason as I have to think the long sad years of youth were worth living for the sake of middle age .
ESTJ	And in my own life , in my own small way , I 've tried to give back to this country that has given me so much . That 's why I left a job at a law firm for a career in public service , working to empower young people to volunteer in their communities . Because I believe that each of us - no matter what our age or background or walk of life - each of us has something to contribute to the life of this nation .
ISFP	I cried on my 18th birthday . I thought 17 was such a nice age . You 're young enough to get away with things , but you 're old enough , too .
INFP	Man has no Body distinct from his Soul for that called Body is a portion of Soul discerned by the five Senses , the chief inlets of Soul in this age .

INTP	Intelligent life on a planet comes of age when it first works out the reason for its own existence .

ESFJ	And I 'm afraid , in this day and age , trust , which I count so , you know , I love loyalty . I love trust .
ENFJ	What turns me on about the digital age , what excited me personally , is that you have closed the gap between dreaming and doing . You see , it used to be that if you wanted to make a record of a song , you needed a studio and a producer . Now , you need a laptop .
ESFJ	I wanted to be a teacher . I love children , so I wanted to deal with children . Then I wanted to be a veterinarian . But by the age of ten or eleven , when I opened my mouth and said , 'Oh , God , what 's this ? ' I kind of knew teaching and being a veterinarian were gon na have to wait .
INFP	It seems as if an age of genius must be succeeded by an age of endeavour riot and extravagance by cleanliness and hard work .
ISFP	I believe we should encourage children to sing and play instruments from an early age .
ESTJ	I 'm at peace with myself and where I am . In the past , I was always looking to see how everybody else was doing . I was n't competitive , I was comparative . I just wanted to be where everybody else was . Now I 've gotten to an age when I am not comparing anymore .
ESTP	We have entered an age in which education is not just a luxury permitting some men an advantage over others . It has become a necessity without which a person is defenseless in this complex , industrialized society . We have truly entered the century of the educated man .
INFJ	It is old age , rather than death , that is to be contrasted with life . Old age is life 's parody , whereas death transforms life into a destiny : in a way it preserves it by giving it the absolute dimension . Death does away with time .
INFP	It 's not catastrophes , murders , deaths , diseases , that age and kill us it 's the way people look and laugh , and run up the steps of omnibuses .
INTP	It 's really amazing that in the age of unbelief , as a smart man called it , there is n't even more fraud . After all , with no God , there 's no one to ever call you to account , and no accounting at all if you can get away with it .
ISFP	In fact , my courage and my bravery at a young age was the thing I was bullied for , a kind of 'Who do you think you are ? '
INTJ	People until I was 60 would always say they thought I looked younger , which I think , without flattering myself , I did , but I think I certainly have , as George Orwell says people do after a certain age , the face they deserve .
INFP	O love , if I regret the age when one savors you , it is not for the hour of pleasure , but for the one that follows it .
ISFP	I 'm well past the age where I 'm acceptable . You get to a certain age and you are forbidden access . You 're not going to get the kind of coverage that you would like in music magazines , you 're not going to get played on radio and you 're not going to get played on television . I have to survive on word of mouth .
INTJ	Well , I 'm in my 60s now . I finally look it , I think . People until I was 60 would always say they thought I looked younger , which I think , without flattering myself , I did , but I think I certainly have , as George Orwell says people do after a certain age , the face they deserve .
INTJ	'Bombing Afghanistan back into the Stone Age ' was quite a favourite headline for some wobbly liberals . The slogan does all the work . But an instant 's thought shows that Afghanistan is being , if anything , bombed out of the Stone Age .
ENFP	Of course , the ideal scenario for parenting is obviously two parents of a mature age .
ENFP	You know what makes me feel old ? When I see girls who are 20-something , or the new crop of actresses , and think , Are n't we kind of the same age ?
ENTP	I 'll tell you , there is nothing better in life than being a late bloomer . I believe that success can happen at any time and at any age .
INFP	You get to a certain age where you prepare yourself for happiness . Sometimes you never remember to actually get happy .
INFJ	If you age with somebody , you go through so many roles - you 're lovers , friends , enemies , colleagues , strangers you 're brother and sister . That 's what intimacy is , if you 're with your soulmate .
ESFJ	With age , you see people fail more . You see yourself fail more . How do you keep that fearlessness of a kid ? You keep going . Luckily , I 'm not afraid to make a fool of myself .
ISFJ	I 'm not as far along as Jack Nicklaus was at this age , but I 'm trying .
INFP	You 'd think that in this age , especially in the 21st century - especially with all the technology and all the discoveries that we 've made - that we would figure out how to tackle abuse .
ENTP	I never - you know also one of the things that would save me for a man my age , it was not that easy to lose that much weight and fall down and look like something draped .
ESTP	My justification is that most people my age spend a lot of time thinking about what they 're going to do for the next five or ten years . The time they spend thinking about their life , I just spend drinking .
INFJ	At a certain age it just became apparent to me that this was probably the work that I would have to do .
ESFJ	Why should 20-year-olds only be considered sexy ? I think we get better with age .
INTP	To be free in an age like ours , one must be in a position of authority . That in itself would be enough to make me ambitious .
INFJ	I remember at the age of five travelling on a trolley car with my mother past a group of women on a picket line at a textile plant , seeing them being viciously beaten by security people . So that kind of thing stayed with me .
ISTP	I 'm asked all the time in interviews about who I am , and I know a few people my age who have a strong sense of self , but I could n't say I know myself and sum it up and give it to you in a little package . I do n't know myself at all yet .
ENFP	Every time I see something terrible , it 's like I see it at age 19 . I keep a freshness that way .
ENFP	Does age matter ? Time does n't matter .
ESTP	Age is the first limitation on roles that I 've ever had to encounter , and I hit that awhile ago .
ESTP	I ca n't hit on women in public any more . I did n't decide this it just does n't feel right at my age .
ENFJ	I knew at an early age I wanted to act . Acting was always easy for me . I do n't believe in predestination , but I do believe that once you get where ever it is you are going , that is where you were going to be .
ISFP	Even from a very early age , I knew I did n't want to miss out on anything life had to offer just because it might be considered dangerous .
ENFJ	I was a mixture of being incredibly old for my age and incredibly backwards . I was born quite old , but then I stopped growing . I lived with my mum and dad till I was 30 .
ESFJ	Craziest thing I 've done for love is getting married . I think it 's crazy . I think it 's crazy , crazy , crazy . I 'm never going to say I would n't do it again but I have to make sure it 's love and not settling for the 'I have to do this by a certain age , ' which is kind of what I did .
INFP	You never choose the way that you 're raised , it 's just the way that you were raised , but you do get to a certain age where you 're in a position to question the expectations of you and the way that you 've been formed by your surroundings .
ENTP	No , no , I was only funny on stage , really . I , I , think I was funny as a person toward my classmates when I was very young . You know , when I was a child , up to about the age of 12 .
ISTJ	I never had little brothers , so I was totally not used to hearing a lot of cussing at a young age ! I learned what 'pull my finger ' meant the hard way .
ENTP	I wrote a screenplay for a 'Sweet Valley High ' adaptation , and it 's really amazing to me how many women who are my age have responded to the idea and are excited about the movie .
ISTP	My best friend just had a baby , and she 's my age . So I 'm a godmom now , which is crazy .
ISTP	I think I 'm a bit less inhibited , and not thinking too much before speaking . It 's not about being shameful , I 'm just a bit more unabashedly myself because of this thing , and it probably started at age 15 . I can be around people and say what I think without fear .
INFJ	The divine right of husbands , like the divine right of kings , may , it is hoped , in this enlightened age , be contested without danger .
INFJ	In every age there has been a stream of popular opinion that has carried all before it , and given a family character , as it were , to the century .
INFP	Look , demanding somebody do anything in this day and age is not going to fly .
INFP	I was very successful from a very early age , and I want to keep it .
ENTJ	I do n't believe in happy endings , but I do believe in happy travels , because ultimately , you die at a very young age , or you live long enough to watch your friends die . It 's a mean thing , life .
ENTP	You can have a spiritual awakening and discover a new side of you at any age . And best of all , love can happen at any age . Life can just start to get exciting when you 're in your 40s and 50s . You have to believe that .
ESTP	America does n't reward people of my age , either in day-to-day life or for their performances .
ENFJ	People tend to become more emotionally intelligent as they age and mature .
ESFJ	With age , you get to a place where you do n't want to knock people out . You just want to give people a hug .
ESTJ	Situational unawareness in the private marketplace or on the battlefield will cost you your livelihood or your life . In the Age of Obama , however , such willful ignorance is a job prerequisite . The less you know the better .
ENFP	I want to be part of the resurgence of things that are tangible , beautiful and soulful , rather than just give in to the digital age . But when I talk to people about this they just say , 'Yeah , I know what you mean , ' and stare at their mobiles .
ISTP	The idea of regretting not doing this seemed insane to me . Sitting in the corner at a bar at age 60 , saying : 'I could 've been Bond . Buy me a drink . ' That 's the saddest place I could be . At least now at 60 I can say : 'I was Bond . Now buy me a drink . '
INFJ	It 's not the normal way to look at things but I experienced death at a really young age and because of that it 's been part of my mental landscape that death is really very possible .
INFJ	I 've an enormous respect for my mother who at the age of 39 raised three children , and I grew up with my grandmother in the household . And so it was a really strong household of women - my poor brother ! It was great growing up with so many generations of women .
ENFJ	It lies in human nature that where you experience your first laughs , you also remember the age kindly .
ESFP	Michelle Pfeiffer has n't been finding a lot of work recently because she does n't like what a woman her age is offered . That 's a real double standard . You get Sean Connery , who gets older and older , still playing opposite young ladies , but it does n't work the other way around .
ENTJ	Even one voice can be heard loudly all over the world in this day and age .
ENTJ	At this age , I should be leading a quiet life .
ISFJ	No , but way before that , I 've been doing little dances in movies for years . Yeah , that was an amazing chance . You know , at my age to be able to do a music dance video , very unusual .
ISFJ	There probably are n't a lot of actors my age who tap dance .
ISTP	I started auditioning when I was about 10 and I did n't get my first job until I was 12 , and two years at that age is really hard .
INTJ	I think women get caught up too much in having a plan - 'I 'm going to get married at this age I 'm going to have a kid at this age ' - and then they just try to find a guy who will fit into that picture . I do n't want my life to be based on that .
ENFP	I think you ca n't really escape any kind of spiritual education as a child , whether it 's New Age or Judaism or Buddhism or whatever it is . You ca n't escape it , even if you completely disagree with it , you still have it as a foundation that you base things off of .
ESFJ	We live in an age , in an era where there is so much negativity , there is so much violence in the world , there is so much unrest and people are at war , that I wanted to promote the word love and red signifies love .
INFP	At a young age , I was interested in comic books , which was really how I learnt to read . The name Cage came from a comic book character called Power Man .
ESFP	I ca n't wait to be that age and hanging out with a bunch of people hanging out all day playing golf and going to the beach , all my own age . We 'd be laughing and having a good time and getting loopy on our prescription drugs . Driving golf carts around . I ca n't wait .
ESFP	I would love a family . I 'm at the age where the wish for a child gets stronger . But who knows .
ESFP	I love physical kinds of comedy and getting down and dirty and doing stunts . When I was growing up , I was always getting into fights with guys and usually punching out boys my age because I was a lot bigger and tougher . So I 'm naturally accustomed to putting myself into the headspace of a girl who can take care of herself .
ENTJ	Maybe it is something to do with age , but I have become fonder of poetry than of prose .
INFJ	I grew up on the golden age of children 's TV .
INFJ	You need some insecurity if you 're an actor . It keeps the pot boiling . I have n't yet started to think about retiring . I was shocked when I heard about Paul Newman retiring at age 82 . Most actors just fade away like old soldiers .
INFP	The age thing really bugs me . Do people have more of a right to not like what I say because I 'm 19 ?
INTP	By the age of 9 or 10 , I knew that I had to cut my own cloth and make my own way .
INTP	When you 're my age and you see a story , you better go for it pretty quickly . I 'd just like to get a few more novels under my belt .
INTP	I do n't know whether it 's age or maturity , but I certainly find myself committed more and more to the looser forms of Western democracy at any price .
INFP	I try to write lyrics so that they wo n't age , which sort of leaves you with the big subjects like death and love and sex and violence .
ENTP	In the modern media age we are rarely surprised by what we see . Whether it 's on television or film or in the theatre , everything is so advertised , so trailed , that most entertainment is merely what you thought it was going to be like .
INFP	Maybe I 'll be a feminist in my old age .
INFP	I feel the 21st century is another new age . Not only can we collaborate again with nature , but we have to . It 's an emergency .
ISFP	I 'd date someone younger or older age does n't matter to me . Or looks , really - it 's all about maturity .
ISTP	I wanted to be a forest ranger or a coal man . At a very early age , I knew I did n't want to do what my dad did , which was work in an office .
ISTP	Parenting is an impossible job at any age .
INFP	You get to a certain age and you just want to prove that you can still rock - that you 've still got it .
INFP	I always thought that I might retire from any form of sexuality by the age of 40 and just become a dignified older person .
INFP	Well , once you 've resigned yourself to the fact that you are the more mature pop performer and you 're past the age you ever thought you would do it , you might as well do it as long as you can . As long as I can still lift a microphone , then I 'll do it , you know .
ESTJ	I think it 's hard , the fact that there 's a certain age that we ca n't have kids anymore .
ENFP	My mother was 45 when she had me , so when I was in high school my parents were the same age as my friends ' grandparents .
ISTP	Despite what anti-aging ads say , growing older can be better . I feel better in my skin , 100 percent . You have greater effects of gravity , but the better sense of yourself you have is something I would n't trade . Women who lie about their age - 'why ? '
ISTP	For the moment I prefer to be a beautiful woman of my age than try desperately to look 30 .
INFJ	To write a story about New York that only deals with people in your age and socioeconomic bracket , that feels dishonest to me . So much of New York comes from everyone bumping into each other .
ESFP	I 've always been intrigued by color and by interesting hair . I was one of those weird little girls doing my own hair at the age of 9 . I was , like , getting weird gels and new brushes and cornrow holders . I would tweak and perm at the age of 13 .
ISTP	My parents got married late and they had kids late , so I never felt a social or cultural thing to be married or pregnant or a homeowner by a certain age .
ISTP	I 'm a pretty big dork . It 's crazy . I 'm one of those people who grew up with all kinds of musicals , but I was right at that age where 'Rent ' was a big deal for me and for my friends .
ISTP	My parents were really , really cool about supporting what I wanted to do at a really young age . I think I was about 10 when I caught the bug . They would drive me down to New York if there were auditions . When I was 12 , I did this show on Broadway called 'High Society , ' so we moved to New York for the run of that .
INFP	Well , my son really loves wildlife . And everytime he draws a polar bear I want to tell him there probably wo n't any by the time ... he 's my age . That 's kinda hard to deal with .
INFP	Traveling to Russia and Germany and being able to see the world at a young age was really cool for me , and I really liked that .
ESFP	I think the most exciting thing is that you expect people our age to know the music , but actually a lot of kids know the music , and if anything is left , we have left really good music , and that 's the important part , not the mop-tops or whatever .
INTP	It is strange to be known so universally and yet to be so lonely .
ISFP	It 's often just enough to be with someone . I do n't need to touch them . Not even talk . A feeling passes between you both . You 're not alone .
ISTJ	Associate with men of good quality if you esteem your own reputation for it is better to be alone than in bad company .
ISFP	I restore myself when I 'm alone .
ISFP	I have to be alone very often . I 'd be quite happy if I spent from Saturday night until Monday morning alone in my apartment . That 's how I refuel .
ISFP	I do n't want to be alone , I want to be left alone .
ESFP	You can not be lonely if you like the person you 're alone with .
ENFP	If it 's true that our species is alone in the universe , then I 'd have to say the universe aimed rather low and settled for very little .
INTJ	Every man must do two things alone he must do his own believing and his own dying .
ESFJ	Loneliness is my least favorite thing about life . The thing that I 'm most worried about is just being alone without anybody to care for or someone who will care for me .
ESFJ	I finally faced the fact that it is n't a crime not having friends . Being alone means you have fewer problems .
INFP	The only real progress lies in learning to be wrong all alone .
INTJ	If you are lonely when you 're alone , you are in bad company .
ENTP	We are rarely proud when we are alone .
INTJ	It 's an interesting combination : Having a great fear of being alone , and having a desperate need for solitude and the solitary experience . That 's always been a tug of war for me .
ENFP	Still and all , why bother ? Here 's my answer . Many people need desperately to receive this message : I feel and think much as you do , care about many of the things you care about , although most people do not care about them . You are not alone .
ISFP	There 's a tremendous difference between alone and lonely . You could be lonely in a group of people . I like being alone . I like eating by myself . I go home at night and just watch a movie or hang out with my dog . I have to exert myself and really say , oh God , I 've got to see my friends 'cause I 'm too content being by myself .
ISFP	The best part about being alone is that you really do n't have to answer to anybody . You do what you want .
INFP	I have so many different personalities in me and I still feel lonely .
ISTJ	Every man is born as many men and dies as a single one .
INFP	I think I jump around more when I 'm alone .
ISFP	For beautiful eyes , look for the good in others for beautiful lips , speak only words of kindness and for poise , walk with the knowledge that you are never alone .
INFJ	Before the throne of the Almighty , man will be judged not by his acts but by his intentions . For God alone reads our hearts .
ISFP	It 's better to be unhappy alone than unhappy with someone - so far .
ISTJ	Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence . Talent will not nothing is more common than unsuccessful people with talent . Genius will not unrewarded genius is almost a proverb . Education will not the world is full of educated failures . Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent .
INFJ	Every government degenerates when trusted to the rulers of the people alone . The people themselves are its only safe depositories .
INFJ	It is error alone which needs the support of government . Truth can stand by itself .
ENFP	The best remedy for those who are afraid , lonely or unhappy is to go outside , somewhere where they can be quiet , alone with the heavens , nature and God . Because only then does one feel that all is as it should be .
INTJ	Our Lord has written the promise of resurrection , not in books alone , but in every leaf in springtime .
ESFP	I think this is the most extraordinary collection of talent , of human knowledge , that has ever been gathered at the White House - with the possible exception of when Thomas Jefferson dined alone .
INFJ	One travels more usefully when alone , because he reflects more .
ENTP	Each player must accept the cards life deals him or her : but once they are in hand , he or she alone must decide how to play the cards in order to win the game .
ISTJ	It is better to be alone than in bad company .
INTJ	Perhaps I know best why it is man alone who laughs he alone suffers so deeply that he had to invent laughter .
ENTP	To Follow by faith alone is to follow blindly .
ESFP	Unconditional war can no longer lead to unconditional victory . It can no longer serve to settle disputes ... can no longer be of concern to great powers alone .
ISFP	I have noticed ... that men usually leave married women alone and are inclined to treat all wives with respect . This is no great credit to married women .
ISFP	I am alone I am always alone no matter what .
ISFP	Some of my foster families used to send me to the movies to get me out of the house and there I 'd sit all day and way into the night .

INFP	If I was writing songs just for me I 'd only play them in my living room , alone .

INFP	I got a lot of problems , but I 'm really good at intuiting what I need to do to be happy with whatever I create . I know when to stop myself , I know when to start , I know when to leave something alone . I guess I just kind of indulge that completely , and so I just take my time .

ESFJ	When I was trying to impress Kate I was trying to cook these amazing fancy dinners and what would happen was I would burn something , something would overspill , something would catch on fire and she would be sitting in the background trying to help , and basically taking control of the whole situation , so I was quite glad she was there at the time .

ISTP	My mother encouraged it so much . She was so supportive . Even if as a kid , I would do the dumbest trick , which now that I look back on some things , she would love it , she would say that 's amazing , or if I 'd make the ugliest drawing , she would hang it up . She was amazing .

ESFJ	I have a wonderful husband . I have three amazing kids .

ESFP	You get moments all the time that kind of make you pinch yourself , some of them make you quite emotional .

INFJ	Anger is the enemy of non-violence and pride is a monster that swallows it up .
INFJ	I know , to banish anger altogether from one 's breast is a difficult task . It can not be achieved through pure personal effort . It can be done only by God 's grace .

ENTP	Anger is never without a reason , but seldom with a good one .

ESTP	Obama and his attack dogs have nothing but hate and anger in their hearts and spew it whenever possible .
ISFP	You 've just got to have a sense of respect for the person you have children with . Anger does n't help anybody . Ultimately you have to say forgiveness is important , and honoring what you had together is important . But it 's easy to say and harder to do .

ESTP	I do n't think your ability to fight has anything to do with how big you are . It 's to do with how much anger is in you .

ISFJ	Mom and Dad were married 64 years . And if you wondered what their secret was , you could have asked the local florist - because every day Dad gave Mom a rose , which he put on her bedside table . That 's how she found out what happened on the day my father died - she went looking for him because that morning , there was no rose .
ENTP	So while an incredible amount of progress has been made , on this fifth anniversary , I wanted to come here and tell the people of this city directly : My administration is going to stand with you - and fight alongside you - until the job is done .

INFP	Were I called on to define , very briefly , the term Art , I should call it 'the reproduction of what the Senses perceive in Nature through the veil of the soul . ' The mere imitation , however accurate , of what is in Nature , entitles no man to the sacred name of 'Artist . '

ISFP	What I 've discovered is that in art , as in music , there 's a lot of truth-and then there 's a lie .

INFP	Land really is the best art .

ISFP	Becoming emancipated at 14 , my life was n't normal . I did n't have to go to school , so I did n't . I was rebellious by nature .

I 'm crazy about photography , and I want to take an art history class .

Some people are blond and some people have dark hair . It 's not a subject . ' This was a very healthy attitude .
ENTJ	My attitude to peace is rather based on the Burmese definition of peace - it really means removing all the negative factors that destroy peace in this world .

ENFP	I keep guitars that are , you know , the neck 's a little bit bent and it 's a little bit out of tune . I want to work and battle it and conquer it and make it express whatever attitude I have at that moment . I want it to be a struggle .

ENFP	I do n't mean this in a stuck-up way , but I needed an attitude song .
ISTP	I met my grandfather just before he died , and it was the first time that I had seen Dad with a relative of his . It was interesting to see my own father as a son and the body language and alteration in attitude that comes with that , and it sort of changed our relationship for the better .

ENTJ	The Senator from Massachusetts has given us ample grounds to doubt the judgment and the attitude he brings to bear on vital issues of national security .
ESFJ	We assume that we 've come so far as compassionate citizens of the world if we do choose to read the news , yet the attitude towards life can be one where we put blinders on and forget that there are civil wars going on .

INFJ	Taught from infancy that beauty is woman 's sceptre , the mind shapes itself to the body , and roaming round its gilt cage , only seeks to adorn its prison .

ISFP	Blues and soul and jazz music has so much pain , so much beauty of raw emotion and passion .
ENTP	People often say that 'beauty is in the eye of the beholder , ' and I say that the most liberating thing about beauty is realizing that you are the beholder . This empowers us to find beauty in places where others have not dared to look , including inside ourselves .

And that 's what 's incredible about it because nobody has done that before , that 's new territory .

INTJ	It 's impossible , I think , however much I 'd become disillusioned politically or evolve into a post-political person , I do n't think I 'd ever change my view that socialism is the best political moment humans have ever come up with .
INTJ	The best people renounce all for one goal , the eternal fame of mortals but most people stuff themselves like cattle .
ISFP	I believe that I often bring out the best in somebody 's talents .
INTP	A Harvard Medical School study has determined that rectal thermometers are still the best way to tell a baby 's temperature . Plus , it really teaches the baby who 's boss .
ENTJ	That 's what liberalism is all about , is promoting incompetence on the basis it 's fair , because people would be the best if they were n't discriminated against .
ENTJ	For the last five years , we have been presented with the idea that Barack Obama is superhuman . Barack Obama is unlike any of us or anyone else . And he is n't . In fact , he 's much less achieved and much less accomplished than most who have gotten half as far as he has , and I think maybe what we saw was the best .
ISFP	I rate Morrissey as one of the best lyricists in Britain . For me , he 's up there with Bryan Ferry .
ISFJ	I 'm aware if I 'm playing at my best I 'm tough to beat . And I enjoy that .
ENFP	That 's what happens nowadays with people working on computers . They can so easily fix things with their mouse and take out all the , 'Oh , somebody coughed in the background we need to take that out ' - or somebody hit a bad note . Those are all the best moments .
ISTP	Your performance depends on your people . Select the best , train them and back them . When errors occur , give sharper guidance . If errors persist or if the fit feels wrong , help them move on . The country can not afford amateur hour in the White House .
INFP	But curb thou the high spirit in thy breast , for gentle ways are best , and keep aloof from sharp contentions .
ISFP	To not be modest about it , you 'll find that with only a couple of exceptions , most of the musicians that I 've worked with have done their best work by far with me .
ENFJ	Let me be the first to tell you , drinking alcohol is the worst thing to do in cold weather . Hot soup is the best because the process of digesting food helps to warm you up .
ESFJ	I have a terrific marriage , but unlike a lot of relationships where they ebb and flow , no matter what happens you fall deeper and deeper in love every day . It 's kind of the best thing that can happen to you . It 's thrilling .
ESFP	If I am a cup maker , I 'm interested in making the best cup I possibly can . My effort goes into that cup , not what people think about it .
ENTJ	The best book , like the best speech , will do it all - make us laugh , think , cry and cheer - preferably in that order .
ESFP	The best thing about acting is that I get to lose myself in another character and actually get paid for it ... It 's a great outlet . I 'm not really sure who I am - it seems I change every day .
ISFP	I 'm so in control of my life , you should n't dislike anything I do-because I 'm not only in the best place I 've ever been , but it keeps getting better and better .
INFJ	The best films of any kind , narrative or documentary , provoke questions .
ENTP	He who laughs most , learns best .
ENTP	The corruption of the best things gives rise to the worst .

ESFJ	You must capture and keep the heart of the original and supremely able man before his brain can do its best .
ISTP	As soon as someone tells me : 'You 're rather sexy , ' I wish I could disappear . If somebody says : 'You were voted the world 's sexiest man , ' I have no idea what that means . How do I respond ? 'Thank you ' is the best you can do . George Clooney is the world 's sexiest man , anyway .
ESFJ	Studies show that children best flourish when one mom and one dad are there to raise them .
ISTJ	There is small risk a general will be regarded with contempt by those he leads , if , whatever he may have to preach , he shows himself best able to perform .

INFP	My 'fear ' is my substance , and probably the best part of me .
ESTP	Disney has the best casting . If he does n't like an actor he just tears him up .
ISFJ	I do n't want to tell President Obama how to make a speech . He 's a much better speech maker than I am . But I think always to tell the truth in a sometimes blatant way , even though it might be temporarily unpopular , is the best approach .
ENFP	I was in the bath at the time , and my dad came running in and said , 'Guess who they want to play Harry Potter ! ? ' and I started to cry . It was probably the best moment of my life .
INFP	For me , the best times are always going to be the most intense , the ones with the highest highs and the lowest lows .
ENTP	The best thing you can do is find a person who loves you for exactly what you are .
ENTP	If being an attractive woman got you attention for directing , then the entire 'best director ' category would be comprised of models . To me , that is just the most ludicrous connection that you could make .
ENTP	Speaking of Twitter , I do n't even know if I composed a blog entry in 2009 , as I was too busy parceling my every thought into cute 140-character sound bites . I used to only worry about being pithy for a living now some of my best lines are wasted on a free app !
ESFP	I get a lot of the ideas when I 'm resting - either when I 'm meditating or getting some kind of work done on my back , like physical therapy or acupuncture . That 's where I get my best ideas , maybe because I 'm balancing my body .
ESFP	I 'm either going to go completely mental , completely bankrupt , or have the best success of my life .
ISTP	One of the best things for a woman to hear is that she is sexy .

ENFJ	The more you praise and celebrate your life , the more there is in life to celebrate .
INFJ	All the world is birthday cake , so take a piece , but not too much .
ISTP	I remember when the candle shop burned down . Everyone stood around singing 'Happy Birthday . '
ENFP	You know you 're getting old when you get that one candle on the cake . It 's like , 'See if you can blow this out . '
ISTP	For my birthday I got a humidifier and a de-humidifier ... I put them in the same room and let them fight it out .
ISFP	The way I see it , you should live everyday like its your birthday .
ESFJ	I 'm not materialistic . I believe in presents from the heart , like a drawing that a child does .
ESFJ	I often buy myself presents . Sometimes I will spend $ 100,000 in one day in a posh boutique .
ISFP	Success is like reaching an important birthday and finding you 're exactly the same .
ESFJ	Just hit my 75th birthday , I 'm feeling great !
ENTJ	Mum loves me being famous ! She is so excited and proud , as she had me so young and could n't support me , so I am living her dream , it 's sweeter for both of us . It 's her 40th birthday soon and I 'm going to buy her 40 presents .
ESFP	I 'll never forget my 24th birthday when my tooth got punched out . And for a second I was like , it would be really hilarious if I sold it on eBay . But I ca n't , that 's just too creepy . I do n't think I can go there .
ENFP	Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority , it is time to pause and reflect .

ESTJ	Business is never so healthy as when , like a chicken , it must do a certain amount of scratching around for what it gets .
INTP	It is not from the benevolence of the butcher , the brewer , or the baker that we expect our dinner , but from their regard to their own interest .
ESTJ	The man who will use his skill and constructive imagination to see how much he can give for a dollar , instead of how little he can give for a dollar , is bound to succeed .

ENTJ	Willingness to change is a strength , even if it means plunging part of the company into total confusion for a while .
ENFP	I was told to avoid the business all together because of the rejection . People would say to me , 'Do n't you want to have a normal job and a normal family ? ' I guess that would be good advice for some people , but I wanted to act .
ENFP	Carpe per diem - seize the check .
ISTJ	There are two kinds of companies , those that work to try to charge more and those that work to charge less . We will be the second .

ENFP	I do n't think meals have any business being deductible . I 'm for separation of calories and corporations .
ESTP	When did it become a problem to be a small businessman and become successful ? The small businessman - like my father , or like me ?
INTP	Discourage litigation . Persuade your neighbors to compromise whenever you can . As a peacemaker the lawyer has superior opportunity of being a good man . There will still be business enough .

INTP	If I were to try to read , much less answer , all the attacks made on me , this shop might as well be closed for any other business .
ESTP	Politics is not a game . It is an earnest business .
INFJ	It is easy enough to be friendly to one 's friends . But to befriend the one who regards himself as your enemy is the quintessence of true religion . The other is mere business .

ENFP	A man should never neglect his family for business .
ESTJ	A business that makes nothing but money is a poor business .
ENTP	It 's time to fundamentally change the way that we do business in Washington . To help build a new foundation for the 21st century , we need to reform our government so that it is more efficient , more transparent , and more creative . That will demand new thinking and a new sense of responsibility for every dollar that is spent .
ESFP	Politics is just like show business . You have a hell of an opening , coast for a while , and then have a hell of a close .
ENFP	The TV business is uglier than most things . It is normally perceived as some kind of cruel and shallow money trench through the heart of the journalism industry , a long plastic hallway where thieves and pimps run free and good men die like dogs , for no good reason .
ENTP	The first mistake in public business is the going into it .
ENTJ	The first rule of any technology used in a business is that automation applied to an efficient operation will magnify the efficiency . The second is that automation applied to an inefficient operation will magnify the inefficiency .
INFP	I must create a system or be enslaved by another mans I will not reason and compare : my business is to create .

ISFP	Ultimately , who you choose to be in a relationship with and what you do in your bedroom is your business .
ISTP	When you 're young , you look at television and think , there 's a conspiracy . The networks have conspired to dumb us down . But when you get a little older , you realize that 's not true . The networks are in business to give people exactly what they want .
ENTJ	Information technology and business are becoming inextricably interwoven . I do n't think anybody can talk meaningfully about one without the talking about the other .
ESTJ	The competitor to be feared is one who never bothers about you at all , but goes on making his own business better all the time .
ISTJ	Let your Discourse with Men of Business be Short and Comprehensive .

ISTP	Microsoft has had two goals in the last 10 years . One was to copy the Mac , and the other was to copy Lotus ' success in the spreadsheet - basically , the applications business .

ISTJ	In the business world , the rearview mirror is always clearer than the windshield .
ISFJ	I have never once regretted missing a business opportunity so that I could be with my children and grandchildren .
ENTP	If you were successful , somebody along the line gave you some help ... Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive . Somebody invested in roads and bridges . If you 've got a business - you did n't build that . Somebody else made that happen .
ENTJ	In this business , by the time you realize you 're in trouble , it 's too late to save yourself . Unless you 're running scared all the time , you 're gone .
ESFP	I love producing . I am loving doing that . I think that is my most natural space in the business . I just love producing or editing and that 's where I thrive .
ISFJ	Business and growing jobs is about taking risk , sometimes failing , sometimes succeeding , but always striving . It is about dreams . Usually , it does n't work out exactly as you might have imagined . Steve Jobs was fired at Apple . He came back and changed the world .
ESTJ	In almost every profession - whether it 's law or journalism , finance or medicine or academia or running a small business - people rely on confidential communications to do their jobs . We count on the space of trust that confidentiality provides . When someone breaches that trust , we are all worse off for it .
ESTP	It 's none of their business that you have to learn how to write . Let them think you were born that way .
ESTJ	I do not believe a man can ever leave his business . He ought to think of it by day and dream of it by night .

ENTJ	This is a fantastic time to be entering the business world , because business is going to change more in the next 10 years than it has in the last 50 .
ISFJ	You know , out-of-touch liberals like Barack Obama say they want a strong economy , but in everything they do , they show they do n't like business very much . But the economy , of course , is simply the product of all the businesses of the nation added together . So it 's a bit like saying you like an omelet , but you do n't like eggs .
ESFP	Business opportunities are like buses , there 's always another one coming .
ISTJ	The business schools reward difficult complex behavior more than simple behavior , but simple behavior is more effective .
ISTJ	Your premium brand had better be delivering something special , or it 's not going to get the business .
ESTP	Prosperous farmers mean more employment , more prosperity for the workers and the business men of every industrial area in the whole country .
ISFJ	Freedom . Freedom of religion . Freedom to speak their mind . Freedom to build a life . And yes , freedom to build a business . With their own hands . This is the essence of the American experience .
ISTJ	When a management with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputation for bad economics , it is the reputation of the business that remains intact .
ESTP	You can close more business in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get people interested in you .
INFP	I do n't want to run around and look at a shot through a monitor . That does n't improve what I 'm trying to do . I figure , once I 've done my job , it 's none of my business .
ISTJ	If a business does well , the stock eventually follows .
ISFJ	And fifth , we will champion small businesses , America 's engine of job growth . That means reducing taxes on business , not raising them . It means simplifying and modernizing the regulations that hurt small business the most . And it means that we must rein in the skyrocketing cost of healthcare by repealing and replacing Obamacare .
ISFJ	I know what it 's like to start a business . I know how extra ordinarily difficult it is to build something from nothing . I know how government kills jobs and , yes , I know how it can help from time- to-time .
ISFJ	Washington has to become an ally of business , not the opposition of business .
ISFJ	When you raise taxes on small business , from 35 % to 40 % , you will kill jobs .
ISFJ	That business we started with 10 people has now grown into a great American success story .
ENTJ	It 's a business you go into because your an egocentric . It 's a very embarrassing profession .
ESTJ	I believe that the rights of women and girls is the unfinished business of the 21st century .
ESTP	The duty of government is to leave commerce to its own capital and credit as well as all other branches of business , protecting all in their legal pursuits , granting exclusive privileges to none .
ESTP	I have made the tough decisions , always with an eye toward the bottom line . Perhaps it 's time America was run like a business .
ENTJ	War is the business of barbarians .
ENTJ	I like Mr. Gorbachev , we can do business together .
ESTJ	I do n't think the government should be in the trailer-park business . I do n't think they know how to run a trailer park .
ESTJ	I do n't think we should be about the business of denying voters in Michigan and Florida the right to be heard .
ISTJ	After all , the chief business of the American people is business . They are profoundly concerned with producing , buying , selling , investing and prospering in the world .

ENTP	I have never yet seen any plan which has not been mended by the observations of those who were much inferior in understanding to the person who took the lead in the business .
ESFJ	No person will make a great business who wants to do it all himself or get all the credit .
INFP	Mental fight means thinking against the current , not with it . It is our business to puncture gas bags and discover the seeds of truth .
ESTP	So we really need jobs now . We have to take jobs away from other countries because other countries are taking our jobs . There is practically not a country that does business with the United States that is n't making - let 's call it a very big profit . I mean China is going to make $ 300 billion on us at least this year .
ESTP	But I believe in fair trade , and I will tell you , I have many , many friends heading up corporations , and people that do just business in China , they say it 's virtually impossible . It 's very , very hard to come into China . And yet , we welcome them with open arms .
ESFJ	The average bright young man who is drafted hates the whole business because an army always tries to eliminate the individual differences in men .
ESFP	To me , business is n't about wearing suits or pleasing stockholders . It 's about being true to yourself , your ideas and focusing on the essentials .
INTJ	Business underlies everything in our national life , including our spiritual life . Witness the fact that in the Lord 's Prayer , the first petition is for daily bread . No one can worship God or love his neighbor on an empty stomach .
INTJ	The success I have achieved in bodybuilding , motion pictures , and business would not have been possible without the generosity of the American people and the freedom here to pursue your dreams .
ISTJ	The business of America is business .
ISFJ	For many my behavior has been a major disappointment , my behavior has caused considerable worry to my business partners , and everyone involved in my business , but most importantly to the young people we influence , I apologize .
ISFJ	My philosophy is : It 's none of my business what people say of me and think of me .
INFP	It 's like you always have to put on a happy face , be the phony baloney , and I 'm so not that . I never was that I 'll never be that . That is part of the business that I do n't like . Maybe that will always keep me an outsider , I do n't know . But that 's fine .
INTP	Business , you know , may bring you money , but friendship hardly ever does .
INTJ	I think a simple rule of business is , if you do the things that are easier first , then you can actually make a lot of progress .
ISTJ	I strongly believe that missionaries make better products . They care more . For a missionary , it 's not just about the business . There has to be a business , and the business has to make sense , but that 's not why you do it . You do it because you have something meaningful that motivates you .
ENTJ	Good business leaders create a vision , articulate the vision , passionately own the vision , and relentlessly drive it to completion .
ESFP	I 'm someone who loves to enjoy life and tries to focus on real things and real friendships . That 's why I live very simply . I 'm a jeans and T-shirt kind of girl . I do n't spend much time fixing myself up or trying to look cool . I live like a normal person and even though I 'm in a very high-profile business , I really do n't let it affect the way I live .
INFP	Almost anyone can be an author the business is to collect money and fame from this state of being .
ESFJ	I started out mopping floors , waiting tables , and tending bar at my dad 's tavern . I put myself through school working odd jobs and night shifts . I poured my heart and soul into a small business . And when I saw how out-of-touch Washington had become with the core values of this great nation , I put my name forward and ran for office .
INTJ	For the first time we 're allowing developers who do n't work at Facebook to develop applications just as if they were . That 's a big deal because it means that all developers have a new way of doing business if they choose to take advantage of it . There are whole companies that are forming whose only product is a Facebook Platform application .
ISFJ	I feel lazy when I 'm not working . I learned all my business sense from my dad . He always believed in me , and I think the last thing he said to me before he passed away was , 'I know you 're gon na be OK . I 'm not worried about you ' .
ENTJ	There is one other business where the customer is always wrong and that 's the media .
ISFP	To keep the record straight , it was n't always John and Yoko . We 've all accused one another of various business things we tend to be pretty paranoid by now , as you can imagine . There 's a lot of money involved .
ESTP	The CIA is made up of boys whose families sent them to Princeton but would n't let them into the family brokerage business .

ISTP	Leave the President 's family business to him . You will have plenty to do without trying to manage the First Family . They are likely to do fine without your help .
ESFP	Duty is the great business of a sea officer all private considerations must give way to it , however painful it may be .
ESFP	Young people in the business have grown up and made the wrong decisions , or bad decisions , and have n't been good role models . To be someone that people look up to is important to me .

ESTP	The business aspect is one of the most important things about having a music career , because every choice you make in a management meeting affects your life a year-and-a-half from now .

INTJ	My dream of politics all my life has been that it is the common business , that it is something we owe to each other to understand and discuss with absolute frankness .
ISFP	Whatever I do , it 's my business . It 's not my job to parent America .
ISTP	You know , I think the film business is its own worst enemy because it sells movies on DVD footage and 'behind the scenes , ' and now it 's a real struggle trying to keep storylines and plotlines a secret .
ESTP	I think all women in Hollywood are known as sex symbols . That 's what our purpose is in this business . You 're merchandised , you 're a product . You 're sold and it 's based on sex . But that 's okay . I think women should be empowered by that , not degraded .
ESFJ	I 'm trying to build a strong business . I want to create new stars , new shows and new products for my audience and create a legacy that outlives me . There are so many other ways I want to reach women besides doing a talk show .

ISFP	It 's been a joy to be a part of other people 's journey , to be able to inspire and be a part of new singers coming up in this business .
ESFJ	I 'm not a kid . You do n't get in this business for anonymity . It 's not like I have posters of myself on the wall , but at the same time , I 'm kind of ready for a little bit of it , but I worry for my little one , and my family - their privacy . That 's what I 'm more protective of .
ESFJ	I 'm a mad lover of sport . You can not say a bad word to me about sports . So I know business is involved and I know it can be cynical , and , of course , I watch it , but for me it 's pure .
ESFJ	At the end of drama school , I made a contract with myself : I 'd try acting for five years . I was 26 . I had already spent eight years working in restaurants and gas stations . So I had seen enough small businesses to understand that that 's what acting is : a small business .
INFJ	When I 've gone back to work , it 's always with that sense of inevitability . That may be a complete delusion , but it 's the one that I need to get out of bed and go about my business . That sense that I ca n't avoid this thing . I better just get on with it .
INFP	After a while of getting jerked around , you realize what the business is really made up of .
INFP	People assume that all artists make for terrible business people , but I 'm in complete charge of my own career .
INFP	There 's a side to this industry that nurtures divas who ca n't write . It 's a big business .
INFP	The business side of film has goofed up so many things , but even that 's changing . It happened to the music industry and now it 's happening to the film studios . It 's crazy what 's going on . But artists should have control of their work especially if , as I always say , you never turn down a good idea and never take a bad idea .
ESFP	I never get the accountants in before I start up a business . It 's done on gut feeling , especially if I can see that they are taking the mickey out of the consumer .

ENTJ	The Internet is the Viagra of big business .
ENFP	Like sex in Victorian England , the reality of Big Business today is our big dirty secret .
ENTJ	Really , I have to laugh because there was a whole set of stories that made me sound like the Dragon Lady , you know , 'tough this and tough that . ' Then there is this business about 'gooey . ' The bottom line is I am a pragmatic idealist .
ENTP	Many people would no more think of entering journalism than the sewage business - which at least does us all some good .
ISFP	I 'm very free-spirited and crazy . I love to have fun , and I like doing stupid things . At the same time , I 'm like a 35-year-old . I have a house . I have a car . I have a steady job . I have a business , and I have to make serious decisions .
INTJ	I started the site when I was 19 . I did n't know much about business back then .
ISTJ	The common question that gets asked in business is , 'why ? ' That 's a good question , but an equally valid question is , 'why not ? '

ENTJ	There 's no business like show business , but there are several businesses like accounting .
ESFP	Well , I think that there 's a very thin dividing line between success and failure . And I think if you start a business without financial backing , you 're likely to go the wrong side of that dividing line .
ISTJ	Teenage girls these days are more and more getting lured into thinking they should dumb themselves down , and that 's going to attract the wrong kind of guy , and it 's serious . It 's serious business .
ISTJ	The camera fails to capture the 'business ' in show business ! We typically will give 10 percent of our salary to the agent , 10 percent to the manager , and 5 percent to the lawyer , plus the publicist gets a flat fee , which needs to be budgeted for .
ENFJ	I feel fine , I do n't care who the director is . All you have to do is know what your doing - all of us - everybody in the business - that 's all you ask anyone - you know your job , I know mine , let 's go do it .
ISTP	I think people are used to seeing actors be wide open and desperately giving of themselves , and while I do that on a movie set as much as I can , it 's so unnatural for me to do it on television , in interviews , in anything like that . I also do n't find that my process as an actor is really anyone else 's business .
ISFP	I am a child but I have to think and act like a woman , this business forces you to .
INTP	I was a good amateur but only an average professional . I soon realized that there was a limit to how far I could rise in the music business , so I left the band and enrolled at New York University .
ESFP	One thing is certain in business . You and everyone around you will make mistakes .
ENFJ	My view is that you still , in order to win from the Labour perspective , have to have a strong alliance with business as well as the unions . You have got to be very much in the centre ground on things like public sector reform .
ESTJ	Desperation is the perfume of the young actor . It 's so satisfying to have gotten rid of it . If you keep smelling it , it can drive you crazy . In this business a lot of people go nuts , go eccentric , even end up dead from it . Not my plan .
ISFP	I still have a lot to learn - about the business , about music , and about myself . Its exciting .
ISTP	Suits are looked at more now as a business thing which is kind of a shame . If you 're not wearing it just for work , you should try and trick it up a bit .
ISTP	I genuinely believe that if you want to get in the film business , get in the film business .
ESFP	My goal in the beginning was to buy my mother a house . Now I realize , okay , if I really focus and become a key player in business , then I can build an empire .
ESFP	Female rappers get it the hardest . You have to be a girl , yet you have to be just as hard as the guys . I think some female rappers get scared out of the business before they can make it .
ESFP	It 's not hard to get your way when it 's your way or the highway . People either follow suit or they 're not around . I do n't really like the sound of that , 'cause that sounds like a temper tantrum . I 'm just very black and white when it comes to my business . There 's really no gray area .
INFJ	Planning cities is a necessary but risky business .
ESFP	I am just at that stage of wondering where I go from here . I came into this business almost by accident , but now it has become serious . What started as a bit of fun , something to do other than be a model , has taken on a different career curve . I have been forced to ask where that curve is going to end up .
ISFJ	I think early on I knew what I was going to do and it was based a lot on familiarity but it was also because I did n't have a lot of skills . There was nothing I wanted t be . I did n't want to be a doctor . I wanted to be in show business .
ISFJ	I think that if I had grown up and had been in show business and the movies twenty five , thirty years earlier , I think I would have made a lot more musical movies .
ISFJ	I think the fact that I was raised in show business , in New York City , in the '50s , that 's affected my personality to the point that I 'm a little different .
ISFJ	Well , I was sort of a jack-of-all-trades in show business for a long time . I was a singer and a dancer and then I got a job as an actor .
ISFJ	I 've made movies that I thought were good . I 've made movies that I thought were okay , but then I was very good . And sometimes you 're in a movie and you think , I wish more people saw that - because you 're good . And it just works out that the movie gets lost . But that 's show business .
ESTP	The more you are in this business , the more humbled by it you become .
ESTP	Show business has been really , really good to me because I can work and take a lot of time off , and I 'm extremely undisciplined person .
ISTJ	There are two ways to extend a business . Take inventory of what you 're good at and extend out from your skills . Or determine what your customers need and work backward , even if it requires learning new skills . Kindle is an example of working backward .
ENTJ	It 's not just Bin Laden or just those that are involved in the counterterrorism effort . We 've got ta cast the net broader than that . But I think it 's a - very special tribute that we all owe to the bravery and courage of the men and women in the intelligence and military business who performed so well to finally get it done .
ENTJ	America 's political system has evolved over the last 50 years in ways that have enhanced the power of business lobbies .
ESFJ	The whole point of being in this business and being blessed and being successful is that you 're able to do things for your friends or your family , which means that they can have something special in their lives , too .
ESFJ	And I trusted someone to look after me on the business side of life .
INFP	As an actor you have to wait for someone to cast you , so you 're relying on the business .
INFJ	It never made sense to me that someone would achieve any kind of success in show business , only to become a jerk .
ENTP	I may be kindly , I am ordinarily gentle , but in my line of business I am obliged to will terribly what I will at all .
INFJ	Just because you 've made a couple movies , you 've done some good movies , you 've been nominated for some Academy Awards , whatever , nobody 's entitled . It 's a business . If they do n't see it , I can think they 're wrong , but I 'm not entitled to a $ 15 million budget to make a film .
ESFP	I 've managed to keep a clear head and remain sane in this business because I remain a kid off-camera .
ENFP	Some people work hard in this business and become really popular , really big stars but they never receive an award from within the business . Somehow , when your colleagues and friends believe in you to the point of handing you an award it means so much more .
INTJ	But the reason I became , why I wanted to be in the business was because there was Midnight Cowboy .
ISTP	I used to be focused on being the dopest rapper in the game , and then once that became what I was , I wanted something different , and I wanted to become the best businessman in the game . I wanted to learn how to master the business like I mastered the rap .
ISTP	The most important decision I 've made in business ? The choices of people I have around me . When I first started I brought everybody with me , my homies from the neighborhood , criminals . I just said , 'Come on everybody , we made it . ' Then I had to realize we did n't make it . I made it .
ISFJ	Our marriage is between us . If we decide to continue being together or not , it 's our business .

ISTJ	If you do n't understand the details of your business you are going to fail .
ENTJ	We have to make America the best place in the world to do business .
ENTJ	You can never get to a place of comfort in this business . As soon as you hit that little cushy spot , somebody 's gon na kick you out . So I have a constant need to do it better .
ENTJ	Our competition for American business is no longer in the next county or the next state , it 's around the world .
ENTJ	If GM had kept up with technology like the computer industry has , we would all be driving $ 25 cars that got 1,000 MPG .
ISTP	I hooked up my accelerator pedal in my car to my brake lights . I hit the gas , people behind me stop , and I 'm gone .

ESTP	A man who has never gone to school may steal from a freight car but if he has a university education , he may steal the whole railroad .
ISTP	Most people have no concept of how an automatic transmission works , yet they know how to drive a car . You do n't have to study physics to understand the laws of motion to drive a car . You do n't have to understand any of this stuff to use Macintosh .
ENTP	I miss Saturday morning , rolling out of bed , not shaving , getting into my car with my girls , driving to the supermarket , squeezing the fruit , getting my car washed , taking walks .

ISTP	I play the harmonica . The only way I can play is if I get my car going really fast , and stick it out the window .
ISTP	I have bad reflexes . I was once run over by a car being pushed by two guys .
ISFP	When you first get money , you buy all these things so no one thinks you 're mean , and you spread it around . You get a chauffeur and you find yourself thrown around the back of this car and you think , I was happier when I had my own little car ! I could drive myself !
INTP	Design can never be an ultimate explanation for anything . It can only be a proximate explanation . A plane or a car is explained by a designer but that 's because the designer himself , the engineer , is explained by natural selection .
ISFJ	I know people think we drive around in these nice cars and we do whatever we want and our parents will pay our credit cards , but that 's not the case . Sure , my parents were generous I got a nice car at 16 , but at 18 I was cut off . I 've worked really hard . I opened the store myself .
ISFJ	White is actually one of my favorite colors . I have a white car . I love white .

ENFP	The first real thought that I had of something that I might do was to write for car magazines , because I always had a car thing .
ESFJ	To this day , I am the least materialistic person I know , because my father did n't raise me to just go out and buy this or that car . The only reason I wanted to make money as an actor was because I 'm passionate about food !
INFP	I remember driving to North Carolina when I was a little girl in a snowstorm to get down to my mom 's family in the Carolinas . There were chains on the car - it was the late sixties - and we were just singing in the car . Christmas carols .

ENFP	I grew up listening to show tunes in the back of the car .
ENFP	People who have car collections - I never understood that . I always thought that was unnecessary . It 's not beautiful , it 's not creative . It 's just showing how much money you 've got .
ESFP	My mother was determined to make us independent . When I was four years old , she stopped the car a few miles from our house and made me find my own way home across the fields . I got hopelessly lost .
ENFP	John D. Rockefeller wanted to dominate oil , but Microsoft wants it all , you name it : cable , media , banking , car dealerships .
ENFJ	I accept the Old Testament as more of an action movie : blood , car chases , evacuations , a lot of special effects , seas dividing , mass murder , adultery . The children of God are running amok , wayward . Maybe that 's why they 're so relatable .
ESTP	I was hit by a car once on my bike , but I still rode home .
ENTP	Fact : The new '90210 ' is cooler than the old '90210 . ' It 's the lithe , streamlined Skipper to the elder series ' venerable Barbie . Gone are the traditional parents - they 've been replaced by a hipster mom n ' pop who get busted necking in the car .
INFP	I look away at car crashes , and I know people who look away at car crashes , because it makes us uncomfortable to watch other people in pain .
INTP	I love sleeping in a moving car more than sleeping in bed .
ENTJ	Consider what kind of car you get . Buy cars and other products that have the least impact environmentally .

ESFJ	My mother gave me this book called Feature Films at Used Car Prices by a guy named Rick Schmidt . I got ta credit the guy , cuz he gave me the most practical advice . It empowers you .
ENTP	I enjoy racing historic motorcars from the '50s and '60s . The seed of my interest was planted when I was about 12 years old and took over my mother 's Morris Minor . I drove it around my father 's farm . But my favorite car is still a McLaren F1 , which I have had for 10 years .
ISFP	When I was really little I would sit in the back of my dad 's car when he 'd be playing old-school music . He 'd turn down the music and turn around and I 'd be singing and know all of the words but I did n't even know how to talk . From then on I 've always wanted to be a singer .
ISFJ	Before now , I 've always taken my mixes out to the car and listened to them in the parking lot . I still do that , but more so now I 'm listening to it on the Beat box , and I think people should give it at least a listen and check it out and see what it is .
ISTP	I think the Smart Car is awesome . The only problem is I 've been on the freeway and felt like I was going to be blown away like a Tim Hortons coffee cup , so I may have to upgrade to a Mini Cooper - something a little stronger .
ENFJ	We each own one car , and we have a reasonable house . It 's a lovely place to be , but it 's not extravagant .

ENTP	I would like you all to give me a round of applause as I have not crashed my car in over 15 months .
INFP	I 'm like , 'Would you be the person in the room that would boo when Dylan went electric ? I know I would n't . Or are you the person that left The Beatles after 'She Loves You , ' or 'Drive My Car ? ' You were n't on board for 'Revolution 9 ' or 'Day In The Life , ' were you ? '
ENFJ	ER was one of my favourites . I played a car accident victim who has leukemia . I got to wear a neck brace and nose tubes for the two days I worked .
INTP	You always hear the phrase , money does n't buy you happiness . But I always in the back of my mind figured a lot of money will buy you a little bit of happiness . But it 's not really true . I got a new car because the old one 's lease expired .
INTJ	Yeah , well I think anyone who likes fast cars will love the Tesla . And it has fantastic handling by the way . I mean this car will crush a Porsche on the track , just crush it . So if you like fast cars , you 'll love this car . And then oh , by the way , it happens to be electric and it 's twice the efficiency of a Prius .
ENFJ	The alarm rings 4:45 , again at 5 , but I wake up 4:30 naturally . Shower , shave , orange juice , perk my own coffee , hear the news , and the CBS car arrives 5:30 .
ENTP	Normally in dangerous situations I have a getaway car .
ENFJ	Change does not roll in on the wheels of inevitability , but comes through continuous struggle . And so we must straighten our backs and work for our freedom . A man ca n't ride you unless your back is bent .

ISTP	For the past 33 years , I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself : 'If today were the last day of my life , would I want to do what I am about to do today ? ' And whenever the answer has been 'No ' for too many days in a row , I know I need to change something .
INFP	I 'm not going to change the way I look or the way I feel to conform to anything . I 've always been a freak . So I 've been a freak all my life and I have to live with that , you know . I 'm one of those people .
ESFP	All great change in America begins at the dinner table .
ESTP	A fanatic is one who ca n't change his mind and wo n't change the subject .

ESTP	I told you I 'm not going to criticize my successor . I 'll just tell you that there are people at Gitmo that will kill American people at a drop of a hat and I do n't believe that persuasion is n't going to work . Therapy is n't going to cause terrorists to change their mind .
ESTP	Political Correctness does n't change us , it shuts us up .
INTJ	Nothing endures but change .
ESTJ	I 've seen firsthand that being president does n't change who you are . It reveals who you are .
ESTJ	It was n't so long ago that I was a working mom myself . And I know that sometimes , much as we all hate to admit it , it 's just easier to park the kids in front of the TV for a few hours , so we can pay the bills or do the laundry or just have some peace and quiet for a change .
ESTJ	I am desperate for change - now - not in 8 years or 12 years , but right now .
ENTJ	The democracy process provides for political and social change without violence .
ESTJ	I do n't have perfect teeth , I 'm not stick thin . I want to be the person who feels great in her body and can say that she loves it and does n't want to change anything .
INFP	Our generation has an incredible amount of realism , yet at the same time it loves to complain and not really change . Because , if it does change , then it wo n't have anything to complain about .
ESTP	I think the tiniest little thing can change the course of your day , which can change the course of your year , which can change who you are .
ESTP	I never want to change so much that people ca n't recognize me .
ESTJ	Nothing is as real as a dream . The world can change around you , but your dream will not . Responsibilities need not erase it . Duties need not obscure it . Because the dream is within you , no one can take it away .
ENTJ	For me , 'revolution ' simply means radical change .
ISFP	The low points I had all helped make up my character , so I probably would n't want to do away with them because I like being flawed and I like having them help me grow and change and become better and stronger .
ENTJ	As I have said for many years throughout this land , we 're borrowing money from China to buy oil from the Persian Gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the future of human civilization . Every bit of that has to change .
ISFP	In order to effect great change , we need to look at how we can help those in our own communities as well as globally .
ESFJ	I just find the evangelical church too , well , restrictive . But the School of Practical Philosophy is nonconfrontational . We believe there are many forms of Scripture . What is true is true and will never change , whether it 's in the Bible or in Shakespeare . It 's about oneness .
ISFJ	There 's no sense in going to a tournament if you do n't believe that you can win it . And that is the belief I have always had . And that is not going to change .
INFP	I think having a child can really change you if you 're open to it .
ENTJ	I do n't think you can work on feelings in politics , apart from anything else , political change can come very unexpectedly , sometimes overnight when you least expect it .
ISFP	I 'm very comfortable with how I look . I always have been . I think I look pretty good . There 's nothing I want to change . I 'm pretty happy with what I 've got .
ESFJ	I spent a lot of my life holding back my cries , and I want to change that because it 's not good for me .
ESFP	I think sometimes when children grow up , their parents grow up . Mine grew up with me . We coexist . I do n't try to change them anymore , and I do n't think they try to change me . We agree to disagree .
ESFP	I love what I do , and when I do n't love what I do , I 'll make a change .
ESFP	I 've always been ambitious since I was nine years old and that was never going to change .
ESFP	I think sometimes when children grow up , their parents grow up . Mine grew up with me . We coexist . I do n't try to change them anymore , and I do n't think they try to change me .
ENFP	People do n't change their behavior unless it makes a difference for them to do so .
INFJ	The customs and fashions of men change like leaves on the bough , some of which go and others come .
INTJ	My goal was never to just create a company . A lot of people misinterpret that , as if I do n't care about revenue or profit or any of those things . But what not being just a company means to me is not being just that - building something that actually makes a really big change in the world .
ENTP	I just think that sometimes we hang onto people or relationships long after they 've ceased to be of any use to either of you . I 'm always meeting new people , and my list of friends seems to change quite a bit .
ENFP	The idea of the sacred is quite simply one of the most conservative notions in any culture , because it seeks to turn other ideas - uncertainty , progress , change - into crimes .
ENTP	I love to watch times change !
ENFJ	It took me so many years to move out . I 'm definitely a bit of a Peter Pan , reluctant to grow up . It all seemed really nice at home-why change it ? Part of me would prefer not to have any responsibility whatsoever .
ENFJ	I have to struggle to change people 's perceptions of me . I grew very frustrated with the perception that I 'm this shy , retiring , inhibited aristocratic creature when I 'm absolutely not like that at all . I think I 'm much more outgoing and exuberant than my image .
ESFP	I change my mind so much I need two boyfriends and a girlfriend .
ENTJ	Do n't manage - lead change before you have to .
ENFJ	If we are to change our world view , images have to change . The artist now has a very important job to do . He 's not a little peripheral figure entertaining rich people , he 's really needed .
ESFJ	The challenge is not to replace Obama but with who . It 's not enough to just change up the uniform , if we do n't change the team and the game plan , we wo n't save our country .
ENFJ	No matter how many modern parts I do , people still refer to me as Mrs. Costume Drama . Fight Club is a studio pic , and I 've done very few of those . I 've got a feeling it 's going to change things for me .
ISFP	It 's been really fun to see with each album when I change to see the fans of the show emulate my style and with the first record a lot of the kids in the crowd were wearing neck ties like I was and now you 'll see a lot of girls with pink hair . It 's cool , it 's actually really neat .
ISFJ	You change with the guys you date .
ESTP	I have found there are four steps to change . 1 . You must want it . 2 . You must believe it . 3 . You must live it . 4 . You will become it .
ISTJ	Believe it or not , lots of people change their majors and abandon their dreams just to avoid a couple of math classes in college .
ISTJ	I did n't think that college math was for me . I did n't think I 'd be able to hack it . And that perception of math not being for girls , not being for girls who see themselves as socially well adjusted has got to change .
INFJ	All cities do face similar , significant trends in the future ... most importantly global warming and climate change .
INFP	There are people in the world who have the power to change our values .
ISTP	I just change with the times . I really do n't have a say in what 's going on . Music was here before me .
ISFJ	It 's important to fall in love with someone you do n't want to change .
ESFJ	I do believe sadly it 's going to take some diseases coming back to realize that we need to change and develop vaccines that are safe .
ENTJ	A zebra does not change its spots .
ENTJ	I think it 's harder for people than it should be . But as more and more of us become carbon neutral and change the patterns in our lives to be part of the solution instead of part of the problem , we are now beginning to see the changes in policy that are needed .
ENFJ	I did n't come into politics to change the Labour Party . I came into politics to change the country .
ISFP	I do n't allow anybody to change me . I still walk outta my house in rollers and I take walks . I do not care what people think .
ENFJ	What 's certain is that a totalitarian enclave like Cuba 's ca n't continue to exist , so change will definitely come there , eventually .
ESFJ	In politics there are some candidates who use change to promote their careers , and then there are those like John McCain who use their careers to promote change .
ESTJ	The problem with being sure that God is on your side is that you ca n't change your mind , because God sure is n't going to change His .
ENFP	If you actually want to change your world , there is a better way of doing it than blowing yourself up .
ISTP	There was a great complexity to my father . He was a devoted family man . But , in the same breath , he simply was not suited to an anchored life . He should have been somebody who had a backpack , an old map , a bit of change in his pocket and that was it - roaming the world .
ESFP	I 'm a role model now . I did n't know I was gon na have 13-year-old fans , so I 've tried to change a few things here and there . But I also know that the girls do n't want me to be Miley Cyrus , either .
ENTJ	Fall is my favorite season in Los Angeles , watching the birds change color and fall from the trees .
ENTJ	The Bush-Cheney administration had betrayed some basic American values . So there was hunger for change .
ENTJ	I do genuinely believe that the political system is not linear . When it reaches a tipping point fashioned by a critical mass of opinion , the slow pace of change we 're used to will no longer be the norm . I see a lot of signs every day that we 're moving closer and closer to that tipping point .
ENFP	A man 's character may be learned from the adjectives which he habitually uses in conversation .
ENTJ	I 'm a great believer that any tool that enhances communication has profound effects in terms of how people can learn from each other , and how they can achieve the kind of freedoms that they 're interested in .
ESFP	To effectively communicate , we must realize that we are all different in the way we perceive the world and use this understanding as a guide to our communication with others .
ENFP	By and large , language is a tool for concealing the truth .
ESTP	I learned never to empty the well of my writing , but always to stop when there was still something there in the deep part of the well , and let it refill at night from the springs that fed it .
ENFP	Of all of our inventions for mass communication , pictures still speak the most universally understood language .
ESFP	Every day I try to be in communication with the universe in an unconscious way .
INTP	A man has a property in his opinions and the free communication of them .
INTJ	The thing that we are trying to do at facebook , is just help people connect and communicate more efficiently .
ENTJ	Number one , cash is king ... number two , communicate ... number three , buy or bury the competition .
ENTJ	I think it 's fair to say that personal computers have become the most empowering tool we 've ever created . They 're tools of communication , they 're tools of creativity , and they can be shaped by their user .
ENFP	Animation can explain whatever the mind of man can conceive . This facility makes it the most versatile and explicit means of communication yet devised for quick mass appreciation .
ENTJ	The strong man is the one who is able to intercept at will the communication between the senses and the mind .
ESTJ	I think we have to face the reality that in a society where there is a legitimate threat of terrorism , not being able to see one 's face , not being able to have some sense of communication in that way , is for many societies a challenge .
ESFJ	We shall never be able to remove suspicion and fear as potential causes of war until communication is permitted to flow , free and open , across international boundaries .
ESTP	Our most tragic error may have been our inability to establish a rapport and a confidence with the press and television with the communication media . I do n't think the press has understood me .
INFJ	The major advances in speed of communication and ability to interact took place more than a century ago . The shift from sailing ships to telegraph was far more radical than that from telephone to email !
INTP	To succeed , you will soon learn , as I did , the importance of a solid foundation in the basics of education - literacy , both verbal and numerical , and communication skills .
INFP	I speak onstage to try to establish some method of communication . The songs are supposed to be a way of communicating . But speech and drinks and sometimes chocolates are also a way of communicating .
INTP	The filmmaking process is a very personal one to me , I mean it really is a personal kind of communication . It 's not as though its a study of fear or any of that stuff .
ISFP	I feel like I was writing as I was learning to talk . Writing was always a go-to form of communication . And I knew I could sing from being in tune with the radio .
ISFP	I feel like I was writing as I was learning to talk . Writing was always a go to form of communication .
ENFP	Computers are like Old Testament gods lots of rules and no mercy .
INTJ	I think computer viruses should count as life . I think it says something about human nature that the only form of life we have created so far is purely destructive . We 've created life in our own image .
ESFJ	Computers make it easier to do a lot of things , but most of the things they make it easier to do do n't need to be done .
ENTJ	Security is , I would say , our top priority because for all the exciting things you will be able to do with computers - organizing your lives , staying in touch with people , being creative - if we do n't solve these security problems , then people will hold back .
INTJ	I do not fear computers . I fear the lack of them .
INTJ	Part of the inhumanity of the computer is that , once it is competently programmed and working smoothly , it is completely honest .
INTP	Personally , I rather look forward to a computer program winning the world chess championship . Humanity needs a lesson in humility .
ESFJ	Computers may save time but they sure waste a lot of paper . About 98 percent of everything printed out by a computer is garbage that no one ever reads .
ENTP	Never trust a computer you ca n't throw out a window .
ENTJ	I was afraid of the internet ... because I could n't type .
ENTP	What I was proud of was that I used very few parts to build a computer that could actually speak words on a screen and type words on a keyboard and run a programming language that could play games . And I did all this myself .
ESFP	Bill Gates is the pope of the personal computer industry . He decides who 's going to build .
ISTP	Computers themselves , and software yet to be developed , will revolutionize the way we learn .
ISTP	We 're going to be able to ask our computers to monitor things for us , and when certain conditions happen , are triggered , the computers will take certain actions and inform us after the fact .
ISTP	This is what customers pay us for - to sweat all these details so it 's easy and pleasant for them to use our computers . We 're supposed to be really good at this . That does n't mean we do n't listen to customers , but it 's hard for them to tell you what they want when they 've never seen anything remotely like it .
INTJ	I just think people have a lot of fiction . But , you know , I mean , the real story of Facebook is just that we 've worked so hard for all this time . I mean , the real story is actually probably pretty boring , right ? I mean , we just sat at our computers for six years and coded .
INTJ	There is no heaven or afterlife for broken-down computers that is a fairy story for people afraid of the dark .
INTJ	There is a real danger that computers will develop intelligence and take over . We urgently need to develop direct connections to the brain so that computers can add to human intelligence rather than be in opposition .
ISFJ	Globalization , as defined by rich people like us , is a very nice thing ... you are talking about the Internet , you are talking about cell phones , you are talking about computers . This does n't affect two-thirds of the people of the world .
INTJ	The real story of Facebook is just that we 've worked so hard for all this time . I mean , the real story is actually probably pretty boring , right ? I mean , we just sat at our computers for six years and coded .
INFP	I 'm not afraid of computers taking over the world .
ISTJ	I 've always been at the intersection of computers and whatever they can revolutionize .
ISFP	Anyway , all these computers and digital gadgets are no good . They just fill your head with numbers and that ca n't be good for you .
ENTP	My whole life had been designing computers I could never build .
ENTP	At our computer club , we talked about it being a revolution . Computers were going to belong to everyone , and give us power , and free us from the people who owned computers and all that stuff .
ENTP	My goal was n't to make a ton of money . It was to build good computers .
INFJ	Nothing gives one person so much advantage over another as to remain always cool and unruffled under all circumstances .
INFP	Rather be dead than cool .
ESTP	All women do have a different sense of sexuality , or sense of fun , or sense of like what 's sexy or cool or tough .
ENTJ	It 's really kind of cool to have solar panels on your roof .
ESTJ	I never cut class . I loved getting A 's , I liked being smart . I liked being on time . I thought being smart is cooler than anything in the world .
ESFJ	Being cool is being your own self , not doing something that someone else is telling you to do .
ESFP	I 'm not the kind of person who tries to be cool or trendy , I 'm definitely an individual .
INFP	It seems like once people grow up , they have no idea what 's cool .
ISFP	So there 's nothing more provocative than taking a genre that everybody who 's cool hates - and then making it cool .
ESTP	All of my favorite people - people I really trust - none of them were cool in their younger years .
INTJ	One cool judgment is worth a thousand hasty counsels . The thing to do is to supply light and not heat .
ESFJ	My perfect guy wears converse , is totally laid back , and does n't worry about being cool .
INFP	I 've never done anything because I thought it would look cool .
INFP	Sometimes just when I say hello the right way , I 'm like , 'Whoa , I 'm so cool . '
ESFJ	You get a timeless cool card in New York .
ENTJ	And not only that , I also have the MacBook Air which is really cool . Even my wife is jealous of my MacBook Air .
ESFJ	I 've never been cool - and I do n't care .
ISTP	I 'm from Iowa , we do n't know what cool is !
INTJ	I do n't think of myself as hot or cool or anything , just a dork .
INTJ	I 'm a mirror . If you 're cool with me , I 'm cool with you , and the exchange starts . What you see is what you reflect . If you do n't like what you see , then you 've done something . If I 'm standoffish , that 's because you are .
ISFP	The cool thing about being famous is traveling . I have always wanted to travel across seas , like to Canada and stuff .
ISFP	I 'm doing everything that I can , working with experts , really studying the statistics to figure out a way we can make it cool or normal to be kind and loving .
ISTP	What people do n't understand is joining a gang ai n't bad , it 's cool , it 's fine . When you in the hood , joining a gang it 's cool because all your friends are in the gang , all your family 's in the gang . We 're not just killing people every night , we 're just hanging out , having a good time .
ISFP	Where I come from it was really unheard of to be at a party and someone says , 'What kind of music do you make ? ' , and you say , 'Pop music . ' You may as well have 'I 'm not cool ' stamped on your forehead .
INTJ	Racism is taught in the home . We agree on that ? Well , it 's very hard to teach racism to a teenager who 's listening to rap music and who idolizes , say , Snoop Dogg . It 's hard to say , 'That guy is less than you . ' The kid is like , 'I like that guy , he 's cool . How is he less than me ?
ESFP	It 's cool when fans spend so much time making things for me . It means a lot .
ESFJ	I do n't go to the cool , trendy restaurants . I go to either the holes in the wall or the super-fancy restaurants where there are no cool people .
ESFP	I think people appreciate a songwriter who shows different sides . The whole angst thing is cool , but if that 's all you 've got , it 's just boring . Everything I write , whether it 's happy or sad , has a sense of humor to it .
ISFP	I remember being on film sets when I was younger , and only men got to do the cool action movies . So I thought , 'Maybe I 'll get to produce one day and get to do cool stuff too , ' which is what happened when we did 'Charlie 's Angels . ' Starting my production company was a big turning point for me .
ESFP	I grew up not really having anything , so the idea that I can take care of my family and my friends now is a really cool bonus .
ESFJ	I once sang 'Summer Nights , ' from 'Grease , ' at a bar in Melbourne with John Travolta , who 's a good friend of mine . He looked cool singing the part of Danny - sitting in an armchair , smoking a cigar - while I got stuck playing Sandy .
ISFJ	It 's cool now to play golf .
ENFP	The nerds are the ones that make the films and do loads of other really cool stuff in their life .
ENFP	I met Elijah Wood once , I met Peter Jackson , I met Orlando Bloom , and they 're all really cool .
ENFP	I 've never been one of the cool people at school , but then again , I do n't get the people who are cool . It 's not that I do n't like them , it 's just that they do n't interest me .
INFP	I did n't watch much TV as a kid and I don ' t watch it now . I don ' t find anything beautiful or unique to the medium , and the only thing you can do on TV that you ca n't do in film is make a continuing story - which is so cool !
ISTJ	If a guy is skilled at anything , that 's attractive . There 's something very primal about that and , sure , it can be as simple as figuring out the tip quickly . It 's really cool when a guy tips 20 percent quickly and effortlessly so that when the check comes , he opens it and signs his name and done .
INTJ	My friends are people who like building cool stuff . We always have this joke about people who want to just start companies without making something valuable . There 's a lot of that in Silicon Valley .
ISTP	I really , specifically , love acting , and I think it 's a really cool thing to be really indulgent and follow that . I have a lot of ambitions in life , but for the next few years , I just want to be an actor . That 's a lucky opportunity , and that drives me to want to be good at that .
ISTJ	It 's really cool when a guy tips 20 per cent quickly and effortlessly so that when the check comes , he opens it and signs his name and done .
ENTP	I want Maggie Gyllenhaal . I do n't know why . I do n't think she necessarily looks like me or acts like me , I just think she 's a cool actress and she could play me , so there you go .
ISTP	I really , specifically , love acting , and I think it 's a really cool thing to be really indulgent and follow that . I have a lot of ambitions in life , but for the next few years , I just want to be an actor .
ISFP	I used to be a cool chick but I 'm not anymore .
INFJ	Cynicism is kind of like folding your arms and stepping back and commenting on things , like the old guys in 'The Muppets , ' just throwing out comments all the time , whereas there are other people on the ground really trying to affect things and improve their lives and the lives of other people . I think it 's noble and I think it 's cool .
INFJ	I have n't left the house without a packet of Kleenex in my back pocket for as long as I can remember . Whenever I start thinking I 'm incredibly cool , the packet of Kleenex in my back pocket brings me right back down to earth .
INFP	There are n't many poster children for cool angst . Everybody thinks it 's cool if you 're the bad girl .
ISTP	How serious can a movie about time-traveling robots be ? You want it to be cool and fun .
INFP	Australia is so cool that it 's hard to even know where to start describing it . The beaches are beautiful so is the weather . Not too crowded . Great food , great music , really nice people . It must be a lot like Los Angeles was many years ago .
ISFP	Justin Timberlake is everything , and what more could you want in a person ? He 's funny . He 's cute . He 's great . He just understands . I get him and he gets me , and that 's cool .
INFP	It 's hard to encapsulate my inspiration because there are so many different looks , but I think it 's just like , sexy girl you see walking down the street in a cool outfit . A lot of eyelet , a lot of leather , playing with the hard and the soft , the good and bad inside of us all .
ENFP	If I was n't even famous or had any success , I would still wake up and put tons of make-up on , and put on a cool outfit . That 's always been who I 've been my whole life , so that 's never gon na change . I love fashion . I love getting dressed up . I love Halloween , too .
ISFP	I 'd love to date somebody cool , fun , funny .
ESFJ	The second I met Zac , I thought he was a really cool guy . It 's hard not to have chemistry with someone who is so attractive .
ESFJ	Being cool , having a 'cool ' energy is just not attractive to me .
ESFJ	I think fashion is a lot of fun . I love clothes . More than fashion or brand labels , I love design . I love the thought that people put into clothes . I love when clothes make cultural statements and I think personal style is really cool . I also freely recognize that fashion should be a hobby .
ESFJ	In my teens , I was never part of the cool crowd .
ISFP	Personally , I was never the cool kid . I was always sort of a bookworm . I would just like to be more like Troy , because he 's so cool .
ISFP	Personally , I was never the cool kid . I was always sort of a bookworm .
ISFP	Spider-Man 's probably my favorite . You see , Batman is a billionaire and there 's nothing really cool about a billionaire saving the world . But Spider-Man is Peter Parker , a conflicted character who puts on a suit and saves the world . I love that .
INFJ	My whole thing is that I want to explore why you read books , what 's the purpose of reading , and maybe that it 's not that cool to hate something just because it 's popular .
ENTP	That was excellent ! I mean , it did n't do anything , but it looked really cool !
ESFP	I think you have to be cool to be a good flirt , and I do n't think I 'm very cool .
ISFP	Music is music , ultimately . If it makes you feel good , cool .
INFP	Our career is a dream . I mean , we get to act , travel around the world , and meet cool people . What 's not to love !
INTJ	Growing up , politics never trickled down to the areas we come from . But people from Obama 's camp , and Obama himself , reached out to me and asked for my help on the campaign . We 've sat and had dinner , and we 've spoken on the phone . He 's a very sharp guy . Very charming . Very cool .
INTJ	You make your first album , you make some money , and you feel like you still have to show face , like 'I still go to the projects . ' I 'm like , why ? Your job is to inspire people from your neighborhood to get out . You grew up there . What makes you think it 's so cool ?
INTP	Most of the time you 're too busy to think about it . But every now and then you say , 'I work at 'Saturday Night Live , ' and that is so cool .
ISFP	I wanted to escape Small Town U.S.A. To dismiss the boundaries , to explore . My life experience came from watching movies , TV , and reading books and magazines . When your culture comes from watching TV everyday , you 're bombarded with images of things that seem cool , places that seem interesting , people who have jobs and careers and opportunities .
ENFP	But acting is very much a profession that is you 're hot one moment and not the next - and that is totally cool . I think that 's what I find most fascinating and most exciting about it - is that it can be gone in a puff of smoke .
ENTP	That was cool and that sucked all at the same time .
ESFJ	What 's weird is that I work with these directors and then I start channeling them . I kind of turn into them a bit - which is cool when you 're working with Clint Eastwood .
ESFJ	I 'd love to be an artist that 's multifaceted . At the moment , I am not . But would n't that be cool if I was like , 'Yeah , let me pull out my guitar and play you a song . ' I would adore that . I am so far not gifted in that way . But I am a very hard worker and a very determined person , so who knows ?
ISFP	What 's cool about indie rock is that one band can do effectively the same thing as another band , and one band nails it , and the other one does n't . I like that elusiveness .
ISFP	It 's cool to be recognised by your peers .
ISFP	The idea of recognising your strengths and using them in as versatile a way as you can is cool to me .
ESFP	Above all , film is a business ... Independence is a really cool thing as you can be a bit more bold , and take a few more chances with what you do .
ENFJ	That was really cool . I got to kiss a little boy . I was 7 and he was 10 , and his name is Thomas Curtis . He was the first boy I 've ever kissed in my entire life and he was three years older than me .
ESFJ	You have to be the best of whatever you are , but successful , cool actresses come in all shapes and sizes .
ENFP	There 's a power in women being women . There 's a role for men , but we do n't have to be men , because we 're women . I think that representing that on television is a cool thing .
ESTJ	Men , when they fight in movies , it 's a very different style . Harrison Ford was so cool when he had the whip , and Bruce Lee was such an artist that you could n't take your eyes off of him .
ENFJ	It was really really neat to make the movie because there were mentally challenged actors in the movie . So that was really really cool to work with them and they were always really happy , and they made everybody really happy on the set too .
ENFJ	Courtney Love is really cool and funny . I would like to meet Julia Roberts and Cameron Diaz . I think I could play their daughters .
ENTP	Tobey 's a mellow , cool guy . He 's just a good guy . I know that 's not the answer you want , and I do n't mean that as the political thing to say , but he 's a nice guy .
ISTP	Your time is limited , so do n't waste it living someone else 's life . Do n't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people 's thinking . Do n't let the noise of others ' opinions drown out your own inner voice . And most important , have the courage to follow your heart and intuition .
ENFJ	I learned that courage was not the absence of fear , but the triumph over it . The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid , but he who conquers that fear .
ESTP	Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen .
ESFP	There are no easy answers ' but there are simple answers . We must have the courage to do what we know is morally right .
ESTP	Courage is grace under pressure .
ENFJ	We must build dikes of courage to hold back the flood of fear .
ENFP	Courage is resistance to fear , mastery of fear , not absence of fear .
ENTJ	You will never do anything in this world without courage . It is the greatest quality of the mind next to honor .
ESFP	Efforts and courage are not enough without purpose and direction .
INFJ	One man with courage is a majority .

ESFP	Above all , we must realize that no arsenal , or no weapon in the arsenals of the world , is so formidable as the will and moral courage of free men and women . It is a weapon our adversaries in today 's world do not have .
ENFP	It is curious that physical courage should be so common in the world and moral courage so rare .
ESTP	Courage is rightly esteemed the first of human qualities ... because it is the quality which guarantees all others .
ESFP	A nation which has forgotten the quality of courage which in the past has been brought to public life is not as likely to insist upon or regard that quality in its chosen leaders today - and in fact we have forgotten .
ENFP	Do you really think it is weakness that yields to temptation ? I tell you that there are terrible temptations which it requires strength , strength and courage to yield to .
ESFP	The courage of life is often a less dramatic spectacle than the courage of a final moment but it is no less a magnificent mixture of triumph and tragedy .
ENTJ	Courage is the first of human qualities because it is the quality which guarantees the others .

ENTJ	The first virtue in a soldier is endurance of fatigue courage is only the second virtue .

ESTP	Today we affirm a new commitment to live out our nation 's promise through civility , courage , compassion and character .

ENTJ	While President Bush likes to project an image of strength and courage , the real truth is that in the presence of his large financial contributors , he is a moral coward .
ISFJ	I think there 's a difference between ditzy and dumb . Dumb is just not knowing . Ditzy is having the courage to ask !

ENTJ	There 's only one requirement of any of us , and that is to be courageous . Because courage , as you might know , defines all other human behavior . And , I believe - because I 've done a little of this myself - pretending to be courageous is just as good as the real thing .

ENTJ	Today , because of President Obama 's courage , kids can stay on their parent 's plan until they are 26 . Insurers can not kick you off your policy because you have hit your limit . They will not be able to deny you because you have a pre-existing condition .
ENFP	Nothing gives a fearful man more courage than another 's fear .
ENFP	TV is so different from the movies . It takes a lot of stamina because you work such long hours . It is really challenging . You are learning the next day 's lines while you are shooting today 's scenes . I found courage I never realised I had . I hope to do more .
ISTP	My definition of courage is never letting anyone define you .
INTJ	When one has not had a good father , one must create one .
ISFP	My father ? I never knew him . Never even seen a picture of him .
INTJ	Whoever does not have a good father should procure one .
ENFP	I stopped loving my father a long time ago . What remained was the slavery to a pattern .

ISFP	I 'm not sure what the future holds but I do know that I 'm going to be positive and not wake up feeling desperate . As my dad said 'Nic , it is what it is , it 's not what it should have been , not what it could have been , it is what it is . '
ESTP	I 've told Billy if I ever caught him cheating , I would n't kill him because I love his children and they need a dad . But I would beat him up . I know where all of his sports injuries are .
ISFJ	My dad had been born in Mexico and his family had to leave during the Mexican revolution .
ISFJ	You know , my dad served in the President 's Cabinet after his time as a governor . He told me he enjoyed being governor a lot more . Now , I understand why . If I do my job well , I can make a difference in people 's lives and I can help our children realize their dreams .
ISFJ	When my mom ran for the Senate , my dad was there for her every step of the way . I can still hear her saying in her beautiful voice , 'Why should women have any less say than men , about the great decisions facing our nation ? '

ESTP	And my dad , you 're a great actor but you 're a better father .
ESFP	I 've got high standards when it comes to boys . As my dad says , all girls should ! I 'm from the South - Tennessee , to be exact - and down there , we 're all about southern hospitality . I know that if I like a guy , he better be nice , and above all , my dad has to approve of him !
ISFJ	Do n't force your kids into sports . I never was . To this day , my dad has never asked me to go play golf . I ask him . It 's the child 's desire to play that matters , not the parent 's desire to have the child play . Fun . Keep it fun .
ISFJ	I always wanted what Mom and Dad had .
ENFP	My dad is still Christian Scientist . My mom 's not , and I 'm not . But I believe in God , and that there 's a higher power and an intelligence that 's bigger than us and that we can rely on . It 's not just us , thinking we are the ones in control of everything . That idea gives me support .
ESFP	My dad raised me with some good advice : 'Always tell the truth . Always shoot from the hip . You might not have many friends , but you 'll never have enemies , because people will always know where you 're coming from . '
INFJ	My dad loves what I do and I support my parents financially because they did n't have a job that gave them a pension .
ISFP	My dad , bless him , was a musician . And his dad had thought that his music was rubbish .
ISFP	I 'm a pretty hands-on dad and make the most of my custody . I take care of my little one whenever I can , and she determines what I can do and where I can do it .
ISFP	When I was younger , my family would go camping and fishing on our ranches . My dad loves being around all kinds of animals . He 's the one who got me to be a really big animal lover .
ISFP	Where I come from , you do n't really talk about how much you 're earning . Those things are private . My dad never told my mum how much he was earning . I 'm certainly not going to tell the world . I 'm doing well .
ISFP	My dad was a particularly polite kind of guy , very courteous .
ISFP	Looking back , I think I was always musical . My dad was very musical , and I think my mom was musical .
ISFP	I 'm very at ease , and I like it . I never thought I would be such a family-oriented guy I did n't think that was part of my makeup . But somebody said that as you get older you become the person you always should have been , and I feel that 's happening to me . I 'm rather surprised at who I am , because I 'm actually like my dad !
ESFP	I get that same queasy , nervous , thrilling feeling every time I go to work . That 's never worn off since I was 12 years-old with my dad 's 8-millimeter movie camera .
ESFP	My dad took me to my first movie .
ISFP	And I saw the sax line-up that he had behind him and I thought , I 'm going to learn the saxophone . When I grow up , I 'm going to play in his band . So I sort of persuaded my dad to get me a kind of a plastic saxophone on the hire purchase plan .
ENFP	I love being a dad . I just love it .
ISFP	I wanted to be a skinny little ballerina but I was a voluptuous little Italian girl whose dad had meatballs on the table every night .
ENFP	My dad became a soap opera actor , and I was an extra in a skating rink scene on the soap . I did n't audition . It was nepotism all the way .
ENTJ	There is nothing that would upset me more than my dad being bribed by the press . It 's like , 'Just let them run it , then . Do n't you give them ammunition . '
ISFP	Great dad . Yeah , he would ask me for money on birthdays and , you know , inappropriate times . And I just wrote him off like , 'You 're not a father . ' I just learned you can not emotionally invest in people who are not attainable .
ESFJ	Now I meditate twice a day for half an hour . In meditation , I can let go of everything . I 'm not Hugh Jackman . I 'm not a dad . I 'm not a husband . I 'm just dipping into that powerful source that creates everything . I take a little bath in it .
ESFJ	One afternoon when I was 9 , my dad told me I 'd be skipping school the next day . Then we drove 12 hours from Melbourne to Sydney for the Centenary Test , a once-in-a-lifetime commemorative cricket match . It was great fun - especially for a kid who was a massive sports fan .
ESFP	I want to be a young dad . By 25 or 26 I want to see myself , like , married or start looking for a family .
ESFJ	My friends say , 'Man you 're going to have kids sleeping on pillowcases with your face on it ! You 're going to be on toothbrushes and magnets and stuff . ' I guess now that I 'm a dad , I 'm thrilled about that .
ESFJ	My kids are not that interested in my movie career , by the way . My son , in particular , never talks about it . He just wants me as his dad .
ESFJ	I 've never heard my dad say a bad word about anybody . He always keeps his emotions in check and is a true gentleman . I was taught that losing it was indulgent , a selfish act .
ISFJ	My dad used to say , 'Just because you dress up in a coat and tie , it does n't influence your intelligence . '
ENFP	I 'm not a religious person . My mom was of Jewish blood and my dad was Protestant .
ENFP	My dad believes in God , I think . I 'm not sure if my mom does . I do n't .
ENFP	My dad 's got a brilliant eye for scripts 'cos he 's a literary agent . He and my agent read a load of scripts and filter them .
ESFP	My dad would give me $ 10 , which is a lot of money when you 're 9 , to sing at church , on tables at restaurants , at family functions , just about anywhere .
ESFP	I think my dad is a lot cooler than other dads . He still acts like he 's still 17 .
ESFP	My dad says I could sing before I could talk , if that 's possible . I was always humming and things like that .
ENFP	I once said to my father , when I was a boy , 'Dad we need a third political party . ' He said to me , 'I 'll settle for a second . '
ESFP	My dad always used to tell me that if they challenge you to an after-school fight , tell them you wo n't wait-you can kick their ass right now .
ENFJ	Overcoming my dad telling me that I could never amount to anything is what has made me the megalomaniac that you see today .
ENFJ	My dad always said , 'Champ , the measure of a man is not how often he is knocked down , but how quickly he gets up . '
ESFP	I have four shelves covered with journals that I 've written . Dad and I are writing songs together . I 've probably written 100 songs .
ESFP	I probably have an earlier curfew than anyone . My mom wants to keep me really safe and my dad 's not overly protective , but he 's a dad no matter what .
ESTP	I 'm the whitest guy you will ever meet . The first time I saw an African-American , my dad had to tell me to stop staring .
ISTJ	When I was little , we had a Golden Book that had all these Disney characters in one portrait on the first page . My dad used to read from it every night . We 'd play this game of find Pluto or find Donald Duck . He 'd read us stories and do all the voices . Those are great memories .
ISFJ	My dad takes care of me as a manager and as a dad . That 's his job , you know , to take care of me . He has my best interests at heart .
ISFJ	I can talk to my dad like he 's my manager , and put 'Dad ' on the back burner . We 've been doing it since I was 13 .
ISTJ	My dad 's a doctor , and when I was 8 , I went to one of his medical conferences where they were demonstrating laser surgery on a chicken . I was so mad that a chicken had to die , I never ate meat again .
ISTJ	When I was in nursery school , the teachers asked me , y'know , 'What does your dad do for a living ? ' So I said 'He helps women get pregnant ! ' They called my mom and they were like , 'What exactly does your husband do ? '
ENFJ	My dad was a militant atheist , or is a militant atheist . My mum was sort of bought up in a religious family because she was a Protestant from Ireland but was n't especially religious .
ESFP	I have to remind my dad , 'Journalists - no matter how many cigars they smoke with you - are not your friends , so do n't talk to them . '
ESFP	My dad 's probably one of the kindest people in the world . When I was younger that 's not how I was- I was a little spoiled brat .
ISFJ	Also for me it was different because I play a lot of villains and in this one I play a dad and I play a good guy , basically . He 's the Secretary of the Treasury . I never had a job like that .
ISTP	My dad was the biggest influence on my life because he was never boring .
ISTP	Look , I 've got incredible pride for my family . I 've absolutely fallen into that cliche of a dad who could just happily talk about my daughter endlessly .
ISFP	My father came from a very poor background , but I was very fortunate in the sense that we were never in need . My dad was determined to make sure that we did n't want for things . He wanted to give us more opportunity than he had , a better shot at a better life .
ESTP	My mother taught public school , went to Harvard and then got her master 's there and taught fifth and sixth grade in a public school . My dad had a more working-class lifestyle . He did n't go to college . He was an auto mechanic and a bartender and a janitor at Harvard .
ESFP	You do need parental guidance and I was in a great position with both my mum and dad . They split when I was a baby but even though I stayed with my mom they were both very much involved in my upbringing .
INFJ	My dad was in the army . World War II . He got his college education from the army . After World War II he became an insurance salesman . Really , I did n't know my dad very well . He and my mother split up after the war . I was raised by my maternal grandmother and grandfather , and by my mother .
ENFP	My mom and dad met at Anaheim High School . After they got married , all they wanted to do was have four children , and they did .
INFP	But I honestly do n't read critics . My dad reads absolutely everything ever written about me . He calls me up to read ecstatic reviews , but I always insist that I ca n't hear them . If you give value to the good reviews , you have to give value to the criticism .
INFP	My dad spent his whole life getting into fights for telling what he believed to be the truth . Basically it comes from my dad-and he 's screaming right-wing , so there you are .
ISFJ	My dad always said he could n't remember a time when I did not want to act .
ISFP	I do love a bit of fashion . I grew up around a lot of it as my mum and dad had clothing stores so my mum was always designing a lot , and I definitely had that as an influence .
ISFP	My dad is such a good man . You know how when you are a child you think your dad is invincible ? Well , I still think that - he is so wise and everything I do I ask my dad 's advice about first .
ISFP	I feel like I 've lived quite a sheltered life , like my mom and dad were quite protective of me .
ESFJ	My mom grew up in poverty in Oklahoma - like Dust Bowl , nine people in one room kind of place - and the way she got out of poverty was through education . My dad grew up without a dad , with very little and he also made his way out through education .
ESFJ	I am lucky to have had an attentive , curious and loving dad and heart-smart , down-to-earth , gifted mother . They changed the outlooks of their own lives and have never forgotten the people and organizations that helped them dream bigger than their circumstances should have allowed .
ESFJ	My dad and my uncles owned a bar outside of Cincinnati . I worked there growing up , mopping floors , waiting tables .
ESTJ	At one point my dad called me and said , 'You have always been a great salesman . I think it 's time you come home and sell swimming pools . '
ESTJ	You know , my mother 's beautiful , my dad was a really handsome man , and there was a lot of talk about looks when I was growing up .
ISFP	My dad read the Bible ten times , and I want to do it in my lifetime . But it 's definitely tough getting through .
ENFP	I was lucky to have my dad in my life . As crazy as things got , I always had him to put his hand on my shoulder .
ENTJ	I grew up in the world of bad television , on my dad 's sets and then as a young schmuck on dating shows and so on .
INFP	I have n't really decided to be an actor yet ! I started doing plays when I was about 15 or 16 . I only did it because my dad saw a bunch of pretty girls in a restaurant and he asked them where they came from and they said drama group . He said , 'Son , that is where you need to go . '
INFP	My dad says he likes to bask in my glow .
ESFP	My first outdoor cooking memories are full of erratic British summers , Dad swearing at a barbecue that he could n't put together , and eventually eating charred sausages , feeling brilliant .
ENTP	In my case , I was born to parents who were very young , and I do n't think they were entirely ready to have a child . My dad was going to college and working two or three jobs at the same time , and my mum was working and going to school .
ISTJ	I 'd love to be a dad . I hope I 'd be great at it . That 's every man 's fear , yet his most important job .
ISTJ	My parents divorced when I was young but I was brought up in two really loving households . I did n't have a contentious relationship with my mom or dad .
ENFP	There 's been times when I 've had heartbreaking moments and I 'm like , 'I ca n't believe you said that , ' or 'I ca n't believe you did that ' . And it hurts , it still hurts , and it 'll always hurt , but I 've never had somebody that I truly cared about just walk out on me , whether it was a boyfriend , or an aunt , mom or dad .
ISTJ	I grew up in a small town in Illinois , and my dad was a basketball coach . Thanks to him , I have excellent fundamentals in both basketball and baseball .
ENFJ	I had to learn how to chop wood actually - I do n't think my dad would have let me go chop wood in the backyard growing up .
ISFP	A lot of young filmmakers bring their movies to my dad because he always gives lots of good editing ideas and notes . He 'd be a good film professor .
ESFP	But although Australia was also involved in the Vietnam conflict , I can remember my dad telling us that if we were in Australia , we would n't be drafted until we were 20 .
ENTP	My dad had been an actor ... not only had my dad been an actor , but his dad had been an actor , and my great-grandfather had been an actor . And who knows before then ?
ENTP	I went and took golf lessons so Dad would let me play with him . I was just terrible ... but I was able to have a wonderful time just walking around with Dad . I can see the real pleasure of that game .
ENFJ	My dad named me Dakota and my mom came up with my first name Hannah . So it 's Hannah Dakota Fanning .
ESFP	Real magic in relationships means an absence of judgment of others .
ESTP	I 'm not the girl who always has a boyfriend . I 'm the girl who rarely has a boyfriend .
ESTP	I like the bad-boy types . Generally the guy I 'm attracted to is the guy in the club with all the tattoos and nail polish . He 's usually the lead singer in a punk band and plays guitar . But my serious boyfriends are relatively clean-cut , nice guys . So it 's strange .
ESTP	There 's only two people in your life you should lie to ... the police and your girlfriend .
ISTJ	Smart women love smart men more than smart men love smart women .
ESFJ	Do not just look at your boyfriend as just a boyfriend . Look at him as a friend , too .
ISFP	Right now I 'm pretty single ... My career is my boyfriend .
ENFP	You know when I feel inwardly beautiful ? When I am with my girlfriends and we are having a 'goddess circle ' .
ENTP	I used to be a real prince charming if I went on a date with a girl . But then I 'd get to where I was likely to have a stroke from the stress of keeping up my act . I 've since learned the key to a good date is to pay attention on her .
ESTP	Well , a girlfriend once told me never to fight with anybody you do n't love .
ISFP	I do n't understand the whole dating thing . I know right off the bat if I 'm interested in someone , and I do n't want them to waste their money on me and take me out to eat if I know I 'm not interested in that person .
ESTJ	Everything I buy is vintage and smells funny . Maybe that 's why I do n't have a boyfriend .
ESFP	I 've never been Romeo who meets a girl and falls for her immediately . It 's been a much slower process for me each time I 've gone into a relationship .
ENFP	My boyfriend calls me 'princess ' , but I think of myself more along the lines of 'monkey ' and 'retard ' .
ESFP	I always say now that I 'm in my blonde years . Because since the end of my marriage , all of my girlfriends have been blonde .
ESTP	Rumors about me ? Calista Flockhart , Pam Anderson , and Matt Damon . That 's who I 'm dating .
ESFJ	I have stepped off the relationship scene to come to terms with myself . I have spent most of my adult life being 'someone 's girlfriend ' , and now I am happy being single .
ISTP	The prospect of dating someone in her twenties becomes less appealing as you get older . At some point in your fife , your tolerance level goes down and you realize that , with someone much younger , there 's nothing really to talk about .
ESFP	I prefer ordinary girls - you know , college students , waitresses , that sort of thing . Most of the girls I go out with are just good friends . Just because I go out to the cinema with a girl , it does n't mean we are dating .
ESFJ	My philosophy of dating is to just fart right away .
INFP	I ca n't even explain to you how terrible that feels , that I equate dating a woman with punishment , shame , guilt , disappointment , reproach , reprimand , persecution . It 's a nightmare .
ESTJ	When I started dating I had this kind of Romeo and Juliet , fateful romantic idea about love which was almost that you were a victim and there was a lot of pain involved and that was how it should be .
ISTP	People say , 'Just say who you 're dating . Then people will stop being so ravenous about it . ' It 's like , No they wo n't ! They 'll ask for specifics .
ISTP	I would n't tell you anything about anybody I cared about because it becomes entertainment for other people , and it sort of just cheapens everything in your life . I would never tell you if I was dating anybody .
ESFJ	I 'm not very experienced with boys or the whole dating thingy .
ESTP	I 'm much more interested in what an actor has to say about something substantial and important than who they 're dating or what clothes they 're wearing or some other asinine , insignificant aspect of their life .
ISFP	Dating is kind of hard . Like dinner or something like that . Like a forced awkward situation is very strange . Especially for me , for some reason .
INTP	Mary Tyler Moore was a working woman whose story lines were not always about dating and men . They were about work friendships and relationships , which is what I feel my adult life has mostly been about .
ENFJ	A man who wo n't die for something is not fit to live .
INTP	The fear of death is the most unjustified of all fears , for there 's no risk of accident for someone who 's dead .
ENFP	The fear of death follows from the fear of life . A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time .
ENFP	I did n't attend the funeral , but I sent a nice letter saying I approved of it .
ENTP	Suicide is man 's way of telling God , 'You ca n't fire me - I quit . '
ENTP	I saw few die of hunger of eating , a hundred thousand .
ENTJ	Death will be a great relief . No more interviews .
ENFJ	Man always dies before he is fully born .
ESTP	It is possible to provide security against other ills , but as far as death is concerned , we men live in a city without walls .
ENTP	I do not agree with what you have to say , but I 'll defend to the death your right to say it .
ENFJ	A nation or civilization that continues to produce soft-minded men purchases its own spiritual death on the installment plan .
INFP	People fear death even more than pain . It 's strange that they fear death . Life hurts a lot more than death . At the point of death , the pain is over . Yeah , I guess it is a friend .
ENFJ	If physical death is the price that I must pay to free my white brothers and sisters from a permanent death of the spirit , then nothing can be more redemptive .
INTP	Intellectual growth should commence at birth and cease only at death .
ENFP	The reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated .
INFP	Cowards die many times before their deaths the valiant never taste of death but once .
ISTP	Remembering that I 'll be dead soon is the most important tool I 've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life . Because almost everything - all external expectations , all pride , all fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death , leaving only what is truly important .
ENFP	Do the thing you fear most and the death of fear is certain .
ISTP	I am not afraid of death , I just do n't want to be there when it happens .

ISTP	Design is not just what it looks like and feels like . Design is how it works .
ENFP	You can design and create , and build the most wonderful place in the world . But it takes people to make the dream a reality .

ESFJ	Designers are very fickle . I never wanted to be a victim of that . You 're in one minute , out the next .
ISTP	A lot of people in our industry have n't had very diverse experiences . So they do n't have enough dots to connect , and they end up with very linear solutions without a broad perspective on the problem . The broader one 's understanding of the human experience , the better design we will have .
ISTP	Design is a funny word . Some people think design means how it looks . But of course , if you dig deeper , it 's really how it works .
ISTP	Design is the fundamental soul of a man-made creation that ends up expressing itself in successive outer layers of the product or service . The iMac is not just the color or translucence or the shape of the shell . The essence of the iMac is to be the finest possible consumer computer in which each element plays together .

ISTP	The design of the Mac was n't what it looked like , although that was part of it . Primarily , it was how it worked . To design something really well , you have to get it . You have to really grok what it 's all about . It takes a passionate commitment to really thoroughly understand something , chew it up , not just quickly swallow it .
ENTJ	Since when has the world of computer software design been about what people want ? This is a simple question of evolution . The day is quickly coming when every knee will bow down to a silicon fist , and you will all beg your binary gods for mercy .

INFP	I 've always been a bit of a decorator . I think if I was n't a singer I 'd probably be in stage setting or interior design or something . I like clutter and I 'm quite visually greedy . I ca n't have things to be plain I have to have things looking interesting ... maybe I 'm just a frustrated interior designer stuck in a singing career .
ESFP	If you only design menus that are essentially junk or fast food , the whole infrastructure supports junk .
ENTP	It would be nice to design a real briefcase - you open it up and it 's your computer but it also stores your books .
ENTP	If I designed a computer with 200 chips , I tried to design it with 150 . And then I would try to design it with 100 . I just tried to find every trick I could in life to design things real tiny .
INTJ	I actually started as a model builder and quickly progressed into production design , which made sense because I could draw and paint . But I kept watching that guy over there who was moving the actors around and setting up the shots .
ISFP	Design is a word that 's come to mean so much that it 's also a word that has come to mean nothing .
ISFP	I have been wildly enthused about gaming since I was younger , and a career path I chose not to go down but did really consider was getting into programming and game design .
ISFP	I discovered at an early age that all I 've ever wanted to do is design .
ISFP	Perhaps I 'd like to design cars , but I do n't think I 'd be much good at it .
ESTJ	In both business and personal life , I 've always found that travel inspires me more than anything else I do . Evidence of the languages , cultures , scenery , food , and design sensibilities that I discover all over the world can be found in every piece of my jewelry .
ISFP	Acting is n't for me . I do n't like being told what to do . I 'm more interested in set design , more visually driven .
ESTJ	And let 's be clear : It 's not enough just to limit ads for foods that are n't healthy . It 's also going to be critical to increase marketing for foods that are healthy .
ESFP	French fries . I love them . Some people are chocolate and sweets people . I love French fries . That and caviar .

ENTP	If I go on a diet and work out , I 'm always in a bad mood . I 'd rather be a little heavier but nice .
ENTJ	It 's never been an issue for me - I do n't want to go on a diet , I do n't want to eat a Caesar salad with no dressing , why would I do that ? I ai n't got time for this , just be happy and do n't be stupid . If I 've got a boyfriend and he loves my body then I 'm not worried .
ISFP	I have to be on such a strict diet constantly .
ENTP	I drink Diet Coke from the minute I get up to the minute I go to bed .
ISFP	I do n't do the gym and I do n't diet . I 'm vegetarian but I do n't diet .
ISFJ	Weight Watchers is not intimidating . It 's not a diet . It 's a lifestyle .
ESFJ	The one thing I like about 'Playboy ' is they do n't have the anorexic look . The women are voluptuous . So I did n't really want to diet . I just wanted to tone up .
ENFP	I try not to be but I 'm super-neurotic about diet . I 'm neurotic about trying not to be neurotic ! I 'm like every other girl . I have to try really hard my whole life to try to be fit . And I 'm super-vain . And I want to wear cute clothes .
ISFJ	I always had to diet . I 'm diabetic , so it 's a lifestyle for me anyway just to stay healthy and not end up in the hospital .
ISFP	I try not to diet because it never really works for me , if I tell myself I ca n't eat something then I tend to want to eat everything in sight .
ESFJ	Since having the babies , I realize that 90 percent of losing weight is my diet .
INFP	Unless you 're living on the street and surviving on a diet of discarded turkey drumsticks , there 's no point in being gloomy . We 've spent too long trying to cheer ourselves up by spending money on brightly coloured things we do n't really need . We 've stopped using our imaginations .
ISFP	When I was pregnant . I exercised and was healthy , but it was also the first time since I was 14 that I was n't on a diet .
ISFJ	I 'm not strictly vegetarian , but meat does n't play a big part in my diet .
ENFP	A dreamer is one who can only find his way by moonlight , and his punishment is that he sees the dawn before the rest of the world .
ESFJ	A dream does n't become reality through magic it takes sweat , determination and hard work .
INFP	Deep into that darkness peering , long I stood there , wondering , fearing , doubting , dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before .
ENFP	Throw your dreams into space like a kite , and you do not know what it will bring back , a new life , a new friend , a new love , a new country .
ENFP	Dreams pass into the reality of action . From the actions stems the dream again and this interdependence produces the highest form of living .
ENFP	Dreams are necessary to life .
ENFP	Myths are public dreams , dreams are private myths .
ISTJ	The interpretation of dreams is the royal road to a knowledge of the unconscious activities of the mind .
ENFP	Dream in a pragmatic way .
ENFJ	We all dream we do not understand our dreams , yet we act as if nothing strange goes on in our sleep minds , strange at least by comparison with the logical , purposeful doings of our minds when we are awake .
INTP	I am accustomed to sleep and in my dreams to imagine the same things that lunatics imagine when awake .
ISFP	I 've always said that one night , I 'm going to find myself in some field somewhere , I 'm standing on grass , and it 's raining , and I 'm with the person I love , and I know I 'm at the very point I 've been dreaming of getting to .

INTJ	Like all dreamers , I mistook disenchantment for truth .
ISFJ	We all keep dreaming , and luckily , dreams come true .

INFJ	I like the dreams of the future better than the history of the past .
ESTP	The only time you really live fully is from thirty to sixty . The young are slaves to dreams the old servants of regrets . Only the middle-aged have all their five senses in the keeping of their wits .

ISFP	I 'll let you be in my dreams if I can be in yours .

ISTJ	Dreams are often most profound when they seem the most crazy .
ENTJ	I really had a lot of dreams when I was a kid , and I think a great deal of that grew out of the fact that I had a chance to read a lot .
ENFP	Our life is composed greatly from dreams , from the unconscious , and they must be brought into connection with action . They must be woven together .
ENFP	I 'd say it 's been my biggest problem all my life ... it 's money . It takes a lot of money to make these dreams come true .
ENFJ	Both dreams and myths are important communications from ourselves to ourselves . If we do not understand the language in which they are written , we miss a great deal of what we know and tell ourselves in those hours when we are not busy manipulating the outside world .
INFJ	When all of your wishes are granted , many of your dreams will be destroyed .
ESTP	In my dreams I hear again the crash of guns , the rattle of musketry , the strange , mournful mutter of the battlefield .
ISTJ	Obviously one must hold oneself responsible for the evil impulses of one 's dreams . In what other way can one deal with them ? Unless the content of the dream rightly understood is inspired by alien spirits , it is part of my own being .
ISFJ	We become not a melting pot but a beautiful mosaic . Different people , different beliefs , different yearnings , different hopes , different dreams .
ESFP	You have many years ahead of you to create the dreams that we ca n't even imagine dreaming . You have done more for the collective unconscious of this planet than you will ever know .
ISFP	Lose your dreams and you might lose your mind .
ESFJ	It 's insecurity that is always chasing you and standing in the way of your dreams .
INTJ	My own dreams fortunately came true in this great state . I became Mr. Universe I became a successful businessman . And even though some people say I still speak with a slight accent , I have reached the top of the acting profession .
ENTP	I 'm not just a boy toy . I have feelings and dreams like anybody else .
ISFP	My parent 's divorce and hard times at school , all those things combined to mold me , to make me grow up quicker . And it gave me the drive to pursue my dreams that I would n't necessarily have had otherwise .
INFP	It is in our idleness , in our dreams , that the submerged truth sometimes comes to the top .
INTJ	There are many talented people who have n't fulfilled their dreams because they over thought it , or they were too cautious , and were unwilling to make the leap of faith .
ISFP	I want my boys to have an understanding of people 's emotions , their insecurities , people 's distress , and their hopes and dreams .
ESFP	There are a lot of things that are personally uncomfortable to show , especially me without makeup and completely bloated or crying . But I 've realized that it 's time for me to show my audience that you do n't have to be perfect to achieve your dreams . Because nobody relates to being perfect .
INFP	Yet it is in our idleness , in our dreams , that the submerged truth sometimes comes to the top .
ENTJ	Freedom and democracy are dreams you never give up .
INFP	My fear is that I go up to the girl of my dreams and say 'I 'm sorry , but I 've got to say hello to you , ' and she slides the stool back and gets up and walks away , saying , 'Not for me , Bub . I do n't want anything to do with you . '

INFJ	To every people the land is given on condition . Perceived or not , there is a Covenant , beyond the constitution , beyond sovereign guarantee , beyond the nation 's sweetest dreams of itself .
ISFP	To be given the opportunity to help shape new artists ' careers and mentor them to see their dreams come to fruition is a task I welcome with open arms .

ENFP	The real hero is always a hero by mistake he dreams of being an honest coward like everybody else .
ESFP	I am so excited to let fans in on how important my relationship with my family is to me . I hope to motivate mothers and daughters to build lifetimes of memories together and inspire kids around the world to live their dreams .
ESFP	There are a lot of things that are personally uncomfortable to show , especially me without makeup and completely bloated or crying . But I 've realized that it 's time for me to show my audience that you do n't have to be perfect to achieve your dreams .
INFP	I think there 's a time as a writer when you want to see the best things in life , and you go out wherever you go with your dreams as a writer or a composer .
ESFJ	There 's always going to be dreams and goals I have , but I never really tell people what they are .
ESFJ	If you 're the type of person who has to fulfill your dreams , you 've got ta be resourceful to make sure you can do it . I came out to California when I was 21 , thinking my New York credentials would take me all the way . I came back home a year later all dejected and a failure .
ISFJ	My life turned out to be beyond my greatest dreams .
ENFP	A dream is a scripture , and many scriptures are nothing but dreams .
ISFJ	I love watching people 's dreams come true .
ISFP	In a couple , sometimes , one or both people have to give up their personal life , dreams and ambitions for the good of the family .
INFP	After having done this whole slew of press for 'Big Love , ' now I 'll have anxiety dreams for like a week and a half about all the stupid things I said . I ca n't even imagine being in front of the cameras all the time . I had a weird dream the other night that I was on 'Jersey Shore . '
INFP	Even having to do the amount of press that I have to do is dreadful and gives me so much anxiety . After having done this whole slew of press for 'Big Love , ' now I 'll have anxiety dreams for like a week and a half about all the stupid things I said .
ENTJ	I say to my colleagues never confine your best work , your hopes , your dreams , the aspiration of the American people to what will be signed by George W. Bush because that is too limiting a factor .
ENTJ	The Columbia is lost , but the dreams that inspired its crew remain with us .
INFP	I think basically becoming famous has taken the place of going to Heaven in modern society , has n't it ? That 's the place where your dreams will come true . It 's an act of faith now they think that 's going to sort things out .
ESFP	In my wildest dreams , I could not have imagined a sweeter life .
ESFJ	I have shared my whole life . My private and my show business life . It helps me actually to feel my songs and to go on with my dreams .
INTP	I work , and then whenever I have any other time , I 'm with my daughter , and then I go to sleep . I think you basically have to abandon the dreams of having any other adult activities in your life . You have to go to sleep whenever your child goes to sleep . That 's basically how we 're doing it .
ESFJ	Anderson Cooper every night dreams about getting my job permanently really .
ENTP	My dreams are of water . And my nightmares .
INTP	I would like to see anyone be able to achieve their dreams , and that 's what this organization does .
ENFJ	When you 're a kid , you have these big ideas and these big dreams to make a change , or maybe you feel like you ca n't make a difference .
INTP	The only thing that interferes with my learning is my education .
ENTJ	It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it .
ENFP	Education is an admirable thing , but it is well to remember from time to time that nothing that is worth knowing can be taught .
ENFP	In the first place , God made idiots . That was for practice . Then he made school boards .
ENTJ	The roots of education are bitter , but the fruit is sweet .
ESFP	The goal of education is the advancement of knowledge and the dissemination of truth .
ENFP	I would rather entertain and hope that people learned something than educate people and hope they were entertained .
ENTJ	I am often amazed at how much more capability and enthusiasm for science there is among elementary school youngsters than among college students .

INFJ	Men and women must be educated , in a great degree , by the opinions and manners of the society they live in .
ISTJ	The willingness to learn new skills is very high .

INTP	It is a miracle that curiosity survives formal education .
ESTP	A thorough knowledge of the Bible is worth more than a college education .
ENFP	Do n't let schooling interfere with your education .
ENFP	I 've never let my school interfere with my education .
ENFP	Cauliflower is nothing but cabbage with a college education .
ESTP	Democracy can not succeed unless those who express their choice are prepared to choose wisely . The real safeguard of democracy , therefore , is education .
ENFP	Education consists mainly of what we have unlearned .
ENFP	I have never let my schooling interfere with my education .
ESTP	Education is the passport to the future , for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today .
ENFP	I never let schooling interfere with my education .
ENFP	Soap and education are not as sudden as a massacre , but they are more deadly in the long run .
ESTP	No part of the education of a politician is more indispensable than the fighting of elections .
INFJ	To penetrate and dissipate these clouds of darkness , the general mind must be strengthened by education .
INFJ	Purity of personal life is the one indispensable condition for building up a sound education .
ESFP	Our progress as a nation can be no swifter than our progress in education . The human mind is our fundamental resource .
ENTJ	Education is an ornament in prosperity and a refuge in adversity .
ENTP	Genius without education is like silver in the mine .
ISTP	If you want to get laid , go to college . If you want an education , go to the library .
INTJ	In large states public education will always be mediocre , for the same reason that in large kitchens the cooking is usually bad .
ISTP	I had a terrible education . I attended a school for emotionally disturbed teachers .
ENTP	Cutting the deficit by gutting our investments in innovation and education is like lightening an overloaded airplane by removing its engine . It may make you feel like you 're flying high at first , but it wo n't take long before you feel the impact .
ESTJ	The truth is , in order to get things like universal health care and a revamped education system , then someone is going to have to give up a piece of their pie so that someone else can have more .
ENTP	Men are born ignorant , not stupid . They are made stupid by education .
ISFP	The greatest education in the world is watching the masters at work .
ISFJ	Natural ability without education has more often raised a man to glory and virtue than education without natural ability .
ENTP	You can choose a future where more Americans have the chance to gain the skills they need to compete , no matter how old they are or how much money they have . Education was the gateway to opportunity for me . It was the gateway for Michelle . And now more than ever , it is the gateway to a middle-class life .
ENTP	We ca n't get to the $ 4 trillion in savings that we need by just cutting the 12 percent of the budget that pays for things like medical research and education funding and food inspectors and the weather service . And we ca n't just do it by making seniors pay more for Medicare .
ENTP	Nature has always had more force than education .
INTP	Give a girl an education and introduce her properly into the world , and ten to one but she has the means of settling well , without further expense to anybody .
ISFJ	Education is the investment our generation makes in the future .
ISFJ	The American culture promotes personal responsibility , the dignity of work , the value of education , the merit of service , devotion to a purpose greater than self , and at the foundation , the pre-eminence of family .
ENTP	We are faced with the paradoxical fact that education has become one of the chief obstacles to intelligence and freedom of thought .
ISFJ	Opportunity expands when there is excellence and choice in education , when taxes are lowered , when every citizen has affordable , portable health insurance and when constitutional freedoms are preserved .
ISFJ	I am running for president to help create a better future . A future where everyone who wants a job can find one . Where no senior fears for the security of their retirement . An America where every parent knows that their child will get an education that leads them to a good job and a bright horizon .
ENFP	The most valuable of all education is the ability to make yourself do the thing you have to do , when it has to be done , whether you like it or not .
ESTJ	There are 4 billion cell phones in use today . Many of them are in the hands of market vendors , rickshaw drivers , and others who 've historically lacked access to education and opportunity . Information networks have become a great leveler , and we should use them together to help lift people out of poverty and give them a freedom from want .
INTJ	Self-education is , I firmly believe , the only kind of education there is .
ENTJ	As people do better , they start voting like Republicans - unless they have too much education and vote Democratic , which proves there can be too much of a good thing .
ESTP	No group and no government can properly prescribe precisely what should constitute the body of knowledge with which true education is concerned .
ESTJ	Let 's not leave an educational vacuum to be filled by religious extremists who go to families who have no other option and offer meals , housing and some form of education . If we are going to combat extremism then we must educate those very same children .

ESFJ	Upon books the collective education of the race depends they are the sole instruments of registering , perpetuating and transmitting thought .
INFP	We are born weak , we need strength helpless , we need aid foolish , we need reason . All that we lack at birth , all that we need when we come to man 's estate , is the gift of education .
ISFJ	The education of a man is never completed until he dies .
INTJ	You know , nothing is more important than education , because nowhere are our stakes higher our future depends on the quality of education of our children today .
ENTP	There is a subconscious way of taking violence as a way of expression , as a normality , and it has a lot of effects in the youth in the way they absorb education and what they hope to get out of life .
INTP	Segregation has no place in the education system .
INTJ	I am a big believer in education , because when I grew up in Austria - when I grew up in Austria I had a great education . I had great teachers .
ESTP	Education is not a problem . Education is an opportunity .
INTP	Men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story . Education has been theirs in so much higher a degree the pen has been in their hands . I will not allow books to prove anything .
ESTP	Until justice is blind to color , until education is unaware of race , until opportunity is unconcerned with the color of men 's skins , emancipation will be a proclamation but not a fact .
INFP	If we help an educated man 's daughter to go to Cambridge are we not forcing her to think not about education but about war ? - not how she can learn , but how she can fight in order that she might win the same advantages as her brothers ?
ESTP	Only a liberal senator from Massachusetts would say that a 49 percent increase in funding for education was not enough .
ESTJ	See , that 's why Barack 's running : to end the war in Iraq responsibly - to build an economy that lifts every family , to make sure health care is available for every American - and to make sure that every child in this nation has a world-class education all the way from preschool to college .
ESFJ	Inclusive , good-quality education is a foundation for dynamic and equitable societies .
ESTJ	I know what it feels like to struggle to get the education that you need .
ESFP	Documentaries are the first line of education , and the second line of education is dramatization , such as 'The Pacific ' .
ESFJ	Universal education is not only a moral imperative but an economic necessity , to pave the way toward making many more nations self-sufficient and self-sustaining .
INTJ	Education : the inculcation of the incomprehensible into the indifferent by the incompetent .
INTJ	My children , to the extent that they have found religion , have found it from me , in that I insist on at least a modicum of religious education for them .
INFP	Do I dare set forth here the most important , the most useful rule of all education ? It is not to save time , but to squander it .

INFJ	The internet could be a very positive step towards education , organisation and participation in a meaningful society .
ESFJ	Those outside of autism need to understand this is an epidemic and we need more government funding , insurance coverage and education reform .

ESTP	You ca n't legislate good will - that comes through education .
ESFJ	My father is a real idealist , and he 's all about learning . If I asked for a pair of Nikes growing up , it was just a resounding 'No . ' But if I asked for a saxophone , one would appear and next day and I 'd be signed up for lessons . So anything to do with education or learning , my father would spare no expense .
ESTP	I 've never been a big believer in formal education .
ENTP	There is not to be found , in all history , any miracle attested by a sufficient number of men , of such unquestioned good sense , education and learning , as to secure us against all delusion in themselves .
ESTJ	I have felt for the last 10 years I have had this battle I 've been fighting so hard to have an education . It 's been this uphill struggle . I was Warner Bros ' pain in the butt . I was their scheduling conflict . I was the one who made life difficult .
ISTJ	I recognize that I have a unique position to be a role model to young girls because I am doing something that they consider glamorous , which is acting , and yet I took a time to really get my education and study mathematics , and I think math is the cat 's meow .
ISTJ	I had done quite a bit of research about math education when I spoke before Congress in 2000 about the importance of women in mathematics . The session of Congress was all about raising more scholarships for girls in college . I told them I felt that it 's too late by college .
ISTJ	What I got which was unusual , especially as a child actress , was parents who believed that Hollywood was not that important . They told us education , family , health , all come first and they meant it .
INFJ	I had never done anything with blue screen before , or prosthetics , or anything like that . Lord of the Rings was like stepping into a videogame for me . It was another world completely . But , to be honest , I basically did it so that I could have the ears . I thought they would really work with my bare head.Working with Martin Scorsese was an absolute minute-by-minute education without him ever being grandiose about it .
ENFJ	My hope was that organizations would start including this range of skills in their training programs - in other words , offer an adult education in social and emotional intelligence .
ENFJ	Education is the best economic policy there is .
ENTJ	I pledge to you today that as president , in my first budget , I will introduce the largest increase in special education ever .
ENTJ	Furthermore , we believe that health care reform , again I said at the beginning of my remarks , that we sent the three pillars that the President 's economic stabilization and job creation initiatives were education and innovation - innovation begins in the classroom - clean energy and climate , addressing the climate issues in an innovative way to keep us number one and competitive in the world with the new technology , and the third , first among equals I may say , is health care , health insurance reform .
INTP	More particularly , having a largely German-oriented education has made me very responsive to 19th-century German literature .
ESFJ	One of the things that 's great about New York is that it is not a one-industry town . It has education , academia , the service industry , arts , publishing , theater , politics , fashion , finance , as well as movie-making .
ESFJ	My parents came from a poor background and worked their way up because of education . They saw it as a way to succeed . So they cared about me getting straight A grades when I was growing up .
ESFJ	We all have a responsibility to volunteer somewhere and I 'm lucky that I get the education and get taken to places to see what 's out there and see what 's happening and to then be a part of it in hopefully an impactful way .
ESFJ	My mom was really vigorous about making sure that we saw things and that we questioned things . Education was so important to both of my parents .
ISTJ	I feel sorry sometimes for these sportsmen and women who put in just as much effort as the footballers . For example , athletes train at least as hard as footballers but have to be happy if they can earn enough to finance a decent education .
ESFJ	The government has convinced parents that at some point it 's no longer their responsibility . And in fact , they force them , in many respects , to turn their children over to the public education system and wrest control from them and block them out of participation of that . That has to change or education will not improve in this country .
ENFJ	Capitalism would have never let me be a filmmaker , living in Flint , Michigan with a high school education . I was going to have to make that happen myself .
INFJ	The value of a good education has never left me .
ISTJ	My mother is a professor of early childhood education . When I was two she would say she knew I was going to be an actor .
ESFJ	The Obama administration now has regulations that tells them that they can no longer promote marriage to these young girls . They can no longer promote marriage as a way of avoiding poverty and bad choices that they make in their life . They can no longer even teach abstinence education . They have to be neutral with respect to how people behave .
ESFJ	I also found that for myself , since I 've had no religious education , it was so interesting to see the different versions of heaven and what life on earth means .
INTP	The environment is everything that is n't me .
ENTJ	I think the cost of energy will come down when we make this transition to renewable energy .
ENTJ	Our world faces a true planetary emergency . I know the phrase sounds shrill , and I know it 's a challenge to the moral imagination .
ESFP	If the federal government had been around when the Creator was putting His hand to this state , Indiana would n't be here . It 'd still be waiting for an environmental impact statement .
INTJ	I have a private plane . But I fly commercial when I go to environmental conferences .
INFJ	There are two problems for our species ' survival - nuclear war and environmental catastrophe - and we 're hurtling towards them . Knowingly .
ISFJ	I 've used the prestige and influence of having been a president of the United States as effectively as possible . And secondly , I 've still been able to carry out my commitments to peace and human rights and environmental quality and freedom and democracy and so forth .
ENFJ	This is absolutely bizarre that we continue to subsidize highways beyond the gasoline tax , airlines , and we do n't subsidize , we do n't want to subsidize a national rail system that has environmental impact .
ENTJ	I took the initiative in moving forward a whole range of initiatives that have proven to be important to our country 's economic growth , environmental protection , improvements in our educational system .
ESFP	Raising awareness on the most pressing environmental issues of our time is more important than ever .
ENFJ	The industrial processes in use today were developed at a time when no one had to consider what the environmental impact was . Who cared ? But making ecological concerns matter to a company 's bottom line will help it do the research and development that will reinvent everything we buy .
ENFJ	I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin , but by the content of their character .
INTP	Before God we are all equally wise - and equally foolish .
ENFJ	I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia , the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit together at the table of brotherhood .
ENFJ	The sweltering summer of the Negro 's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality .
INTP	Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent , a new nation , conceived in Liberty , and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal .
INTP	These men ask for just the same thing , fairness , and fairness only . This , so far as in my power , they , and all others , shall have .
INFJ	I believe in equality for everyone , except reporters and photographers .
ISFP	All this talk about equality . The only thing people really have in common is that they are all going to die .
ENTP	In America everybody is of the opinion that he has no social superiors , since all men are equal , but he does not admit that he has no social inferiors , for , from the time of Jefferson onward , the doctrine that all men are equal applies only upwards , not downwards .
ISFJ	Racism is still with us . But it is up to us to prepare our children for what they have to meet , and , hopefully , we shall overcome .
ESTP	The wisdom of man never yet contrived a system of taxation that would operate with perfect equality .
ENTJ	The battle for women 's rights has been largely won .
ENFP	The year was 2081 , and everyone was finally equal .
INTJ	There can be no equality or opportunity if men and women and children be not shielded in their lives from the consequences of great industrial and social processes which they can not alter , control , or singly cope with .
INFJ	Virtue can only flourish among equals .
ESTP	Nobody can give you freedom . Nobody can give you equality or justice or anything . If you 're a man , you take it .
ENFP	Here are the values that I stand for : honesty , equality , kindness , compassion , treating people the way you want to be treated and helping those in need . To me , those are traditional values .
ENTP	With patient and firm determination , I am going to press on for jobs . I 'm going to press on for equality . I 'm going to press on for the sake of our children . I 'm going to press on for the sake of all those families who are struggling right now . I do n't have time to feel sorry for myself . I do n't have time to complain . I am going to press on .
ENFJ	Just as modern mass production requires the standardization of commodities , so the social process requires standardization of man , and this standardization is called equality .
INFP	No advance in wealth , no softening of manners , no reform or revolution has ever brought human equality a millimeter nearer .
ENFJ	You see , Africa makes a fool of our idea of justice . It makes a farce of our idea of equality . It mocks our pieties . It doubts our concern . It questions our commitment . Because there is no way we can look at what 's happening in Africa , and if we 're honest , conclude that it would ever be allowed to happen anywhere else .
ISFJ	A fundamentalist ca n't bring himself or herself to negotiate with people who disagree with them because the negotiating process itself is an indication of implied equality .
ISFJ	I believe there is complete equality between men and women . And I believe those passages in the New Testament , not by Jesus , but by Paul , that say women should not adorn themselves , they should always wear hats or color their hair in church - things like that - I think they are signs of the times and should not apply to modern-day life .
ESFP	For a modern woman it is important to be supported and that there is equality in every aspect , and that it 's not two halves that make a whole - it 's two wholes that make a whole .
ENFP	OK , in all seriousness , I would say I could n't be in a relationship without equality , generosity , integrity , spirit , kindness and humor . And awesomeness .
ENTJ	Marriage equality is about more than just marriage . It 's about something greater . It 's about acceptance .
ENFJ	So what we 're talking about here is human rights . The right to live like a human . The right to live , period . And what we 're facing in Africa is an unprecedented threat to human dignity and equality .
ISTJ	I 've always been hopeful about Scotland 's prospects . And I now believe more than ever that Scotland is within touching distance of achieving independence and equality .
ENTJ	For 25 years , it has been my privilege to represent the city of San Francisco and the great state of California to work to strengthen our vibrant middle class to secure opportunity and equality .
INFP	Feminism is just about equality , really , and there 's so much stuff attached to the word , when it 's actually so simple . I do n't know why it 's always so bogged down .
ESFJ	I believe I 've always been a big believer in equality . No one has ever been able to tell me I could n't do something because I was a girl .
ENFP	Feudal societies do n't create great cinema we have great theatre . The egalitarian societies create great cinema . The Americans , the French . Because equality is sort of what the cinema deals with . It deals with stories which do n't fall into 'Everybody in their place and who 's who , ' and all that . But the theatre 's full of that .
INTP	The only source of knowledge is experience .
ENFP	Experience is simply the name we give our mistakes .
ENFP	A man who carries a cat by the tail learns something he can learn in no other way .
INTP	It has been my experience that folks who have no vices have very few virtues .
ENFP	Experience is one thing you ca n't get for nothing .
INFP	You can not create experience . You must undergo it .
INFP	When you have really exhausted an experience you always reverence and love it .
ENTJ	Experience is the teacher of all things .
ENFP	Experience teaches only the teachable .
INTP	Experience without theory is blind , but theory without experience is mere intellectual play .
ENTP	There are many truths of which the full meaning can not be realized until personal experience has brought it home .
ENFP	Experience is not what happens to you it 's what you do with what happens to you .
INTP	It was the experience of mystery - even if mixed with fear - that engendered religion .
INFJ	Experience demands that man is the only animal which devours his own kind , for I can apply no milder term to the general prey of the rich on the poor .
ISTJ	Let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion . Reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle .
ENFP	I do n't believe people are looking for the meaning of life as much as they are looking for the experience of being alive .
ESTJ	If money is your hope for independence you will never have it . The only real security that a man will have in this world is a reserve of knowledge , experience , and ability .
ESFP	Beliefs have the power to create and the power to destroy . Human beings have the awesome ability to take any experience of their lives and create a meaning that disempowers them or one that can literally save their lives .
ENFJ	Never , never and never again shall it be that this beautiful land will again experience the oppression of one by another .
INFP	I had rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad and to travel for it too !
ESFP	Be brave . Take risks . Nothing can substitute experience .
ISTJ	Experience teaches us that it is much easier to prevent an enemy from posting themselves than it is to dislodge them after they have got possession .
INFJ	Unwearied ceaseless effort is the price that must be paid for turning faith into a rich infallible experience .
ENFJ	I am a woman in process . I 'm just trying like everybody else . I try to take every conflict , every experience , and learn from it . Life is never dull .
ENTP	Experience keeps a dear school , but fools will learn in no other .
ISFP	Fame will go by and , so long , I 've had you , fame . If it goes by , I 've always known it was fickle . So at least it 's something I experience , but that 's not where I live .
ISFP	I probably hold the distinction of being one movie star who , by all laws of logic , should never have made it . At each stage of my career , I lacked the experience .
ISTP	Sex without love is a meaningless experience , but as far as meaningless experiences go its pretty damn good .
INTJ	Experience , as a desire for experience , does not come off . We must not study ourselves while having an experience .
INTJ	To use the same words is not a sufficient guarantee of understanding one must use the same words for the same genus of inward experience ultimately one must have one 's experiences in common .
INFP	Experience has shown , and a true philosophy will always show , that a vast , perhaps the larger portion of the truth arises from the seemingly irrelevant .
ENFP	What each must seek in his life never was on land or sea . It is something out of his own unique potentiality for experience , something that never has been and never could have been experienced by anyone else .
ESFP	Only those who have learned the power of sincere and selfless contribution experience life 's deepest joy : true fulfillment .
ISTJ	We should not look back unless it is to derive useful lessons from past errors , and for the purpose of profiting by dearly bought experience .
ENFP	I do n't have to have faith , I have experience .
ISTJ	There can be no greater error than to expect , or calculate , upon real favors from nation to nation . It is an illusion which experience must cure , which a just pride ought to discard .
ENTP	Is there anyone so wise as to learn by the experience of others ?
ISTP	Our DNA is as a consumer company - for that individual customer who 's voting thumbs up or thumbs down . That 's who we think about . And we think that our job is to take responsibility for the complete user experience . And if it 's not up to par , it 's our fault , plain and simply .
ISTJ	I have found little that is 'good ' about human beings on the whole . In my experience most of them are trash , no matter whether they publicly subscribe to this or that ethical doctrine or to none at all . That is something that you can not say aloud , or perhaps even think .
ISTP	I do n't think I 've ever worked so hard on something , but working on Macintosh was the neatest experience of my life . Almost everyone who worked on it will say that . None of us wanted to release it at the end . It was as though we knew that once it was out of our hands , it would n't be ours anymore .
ESFP	Take control of your consistent emotions and begin to consciously and deliberately reshape your daily experience of life .
ISFP	You learn from a conglomeration of the incredible past - whatever experience gotten in any way whatsoever .
ESTJ	The only real security that a man can have in this world is a reserve of knowledge , experience and ability .
ESTP	You have people come into your life shockingly and surprisingly . You have losses that you never thought you 'd experience . You have rejection and you have learn how to deal with that and how to get up the next day and go on with it .
ENTJ	DOS is ugly and interferes with users ' experience .
INFP	It 's good to experience Hollywood in short bursts , I guess . Little snippets . I do n't think I can handle being here all the time , it 's pretty nutty .
ISTJ	Knowledge comes , but wisdom lingers . It may not be difficult to store up in the mind a vast quantity of facts within a comparatively short time , but the ability to form judgments requires the severe discipline of hard work and the tempering heat of experience and maturity .
ENFP	How is it possible that a being with such sensitive jewels as the eyes , such enchanted musical instruments as the ears , and such fabulous arabesque of nerves as the brain can experience itself anything less than a god .
INTJ	Experience praises the most happy the one who made the most people happy .

ESTJ	Going out and playing football or baseball with the boys , when I was a tomboy , was a great way to learn about winning and losing , and most girls did n't have that experience .
ISTJ	When people speak to you about a preventive war , you tell them to go and fight it . After my experience , I have come to hate war .
ENTP	Taste every fruit of every tree in the garden at least once . It is an insult to creation not to experience it fully . Temperance is wickedness .
ESFJ	My own experience is use the tools that are out there . Use the digital world . But never lose sight of the need to reach out and talk to other people who do n't share your view . Listen to them and see if you can find a way to compromise .
INTP	Screaming at children over their grades , especially to the point of the child 's tears , is child abuse , pure and simple . It 's not funny and it 's not good parenting . It is a crushing , scarring , disastrous experience for the child . It is n't the least bit funny .
INFP	Every secret of a writer 's soul , every experience of his life , every quality of his mind is written large in his works .
ISTJ	The act of birth is the first experience of anxiety , and thus the source and prototype of the affect of anxiety .
ENTP	In the revolt against idealism , the ambiguities of the word experience have been perceived , with the result that realists have more and more avoided the word .
ENTP	Life has a certain flavor for those who have fought and risked all that the sheltered and protected can never experience .
ESFJ	Experience has shown how deeply the seeds of war are planted by economic rivalry and social injustice .
INFP	What is the price of experience ? Do men buy it for a song ? Or wisdom for a dance in the street ? No , it is bought with the price of all the man hath , his house , his wife , his children .
INTP	No man 's knowledge here can go beyond his experience .
ESFJ	The reward of suffering is experience .
ESFP	The physical world , including our bodies , is a response of the observer . We create our bodies as we create the experience of our world .
INTJ	Acting is a question of absorbing other people 's personalities and adding some of your own experience .
INTP	The only relevant test of the validity of a hypothesis is comparison of prediction with experience .
INTP	It is beyond a doubt that all our knowledge that begins with experience .
INTP	But perhaps the rest of us could have separate classes in science appreciation , the wonder of science , scientific ways of thinking , and the history of scientific ideas , rather than laboratory experience .
ENFJ	No experience is a cause of success or failure . We do not suffer from the shock of our experiences , so-called trauma - but we make out of them just what suits our purposes .
INTJ	You can not , in human experience , rush into the light . You have to go through the twilight into the broadening day before the noon comes and the full sun is upon the landscape .
ISFJ	I do n't claim to be knowledgeable about theology . Most of my knowledge comes out of my experience and the lessons in the Bible . Every Sunday I 'm home I teach 45 minutes and we boiled them down to one page for the new book , 'Through the Year with Jimmy Carter . '
INFP	Masterpieces are not single and solitary births they are the outcome of many years of thinking in common , of thinking by the body of the people , so that the experience of the mass is behind the single voice .
INTP	But although all our knowledge begins with experience , it does not follow that it arises from experience .
INTJ	To 'choose ' dogma and faith over doubt and experience is to throw out the ripening vintage and to reach greedily for the Kool-Aid .
ESFJ	I maybe had a first love and had my heart broken , but reflecting on it , I do n't think that was love . I think as I 'm getting older and having more in-depth relationships , maybe I 'll experience it . At the moment , I do n't know , exactly , if I 've been in love .
ISFP	Yes , I 've been trepanned . That 's quite an interesting experience , especially for my brain surgeon , who saw my thoughts flying around in my brain .
ESTP	There is no more lively sensation than that of pain its impressions are certain and dependable , they never deceive as may those of the pleasure women perpetually feign and almost never experience .
ENTP	The dictum that truth always triumphs over persecution is one of the pleasant falsehoods which men repeat after one another till they pass into commonplaces , but which all experience refutes .
ISFP	It would be my guess that Madonna is not a very happy woman . From my own experience , having gone through persona changes like that , that kind of clawing need to be the center of attention is not a pleasant place to be .
ENTP	Imagine a judicial nominee said 'my experience as a white man makes me better than a Latina woman . ' Would n't they have to withdraw ? New racism is no better than old racism .
INFP	The experience of life consists of the experience which the spirit has of itself in matter and as matter , in mind and as mind , in emotion , as emotion , etc .
ESTJ	But it 's a journey and the sad thing is you only learn from experience , so as much as someone can tell you things , you have to go out there and make your own mistakes in order to learn .
ENTP	Of two pleasures , if there be one which all or almost all who have experience of both give a decided preference , irrespective of any feeling of moral obligation to prefer it , that is the more desirable pleasure .

ENFP	I 'm not one aspect of the human experience - none of us is .
INFP	Talking with you is sort of the conversational equivalent of an out of body experience .
ISTJ	If you do build a great experience , customers tell each other about that . Word of mouth is very powerful .
ENTP	This has been a learning experience for me . I also thought that privacy was something we were granted in the Constitution . I have learned from this when in fact the word privacy does not appear in the Constitution .
ISFJ	The experience of democracy is like the experience of life itself-always changing , infinite in its variety , sometimes turbulent and all the more valuable for having been tested by adversity .
ESTP	Sure , I suffered a lot . But it 's not like the end of the world and it 's not who I am . I lead quite a pleasant life and I 'm able to divorce a perceived reality from my actual experience of life .
ESFJ	Parents of recovered children , and I 've met hundreds , all share the same experience of doubters and deniers telling us our child must have never even had autism or that the recovery was simply nature 's course . We all know better , and frankly we 're too busy helping other parents to really care .
ESFP	I do n't care how smart a kid you are . The only way you learn what 's not right is from experience .
INTP	Poets are the only people to whom love is not only a crucial , but an indispensable experience , which entitles them to mistake it for a universal one .
ISFJ	The amount of meetings I 've been in - people would be shocked . But that 's how you gain experience , how you can gain knowledge , being in meetings and participating . You learn and grow .
ENFP	I would love to work in America . I would n't love to live there , but I 'd love to experience working there .
ENFP	I had one relative who passed away but fortunately none others . So my sort of experience of it is quite limited , thankfully .
ESTJ	As the leader of twelve apostles , even Jesus had more executive experience than Obama .
INFP	If we did n't want to upset anyone , we would make films about sewing , but even that could be dangerous . But I think finally , in a film , it is how the balance is and the feelings are . But I think there has to be those contrasts and strong things within a film for the total experience .
INFJ	I would wish for any one of my colleagues to have the experience of working with Martin Scorsese once in their lifetime .
ENFP	It 's my experience that you really ca n't lose when you try the truth .
ISTJ	Going to a party , for me , is as much a learning experience as , you know , sitting in a lecture .
INFP	Sometimes I get so bold and I 'm so confident about what I 'm doing that I actually try to be more of a dork because it 's a really liberating feeling to experience what it 's like to not care .
ENFJ	The deeper the experience of an absence of meaning - in other words , of absurdity - the more energetically meaning is sought .
ENTP	Experience is what you get while looking for something else .
ESTJ	Whether born from experience or inherent physiological or cultural differences our gender and national origins may and will make a difference in our judging .
ENTP	I had the experience last year of directing my first feature while I had a 1-year-old son and while I was also pregnant , so I am now well aware of the difficulties women who are rearing children face when they 're also trying to make headway in mainstream of film .
ENTP	You know , it should n't just be about women as heroic figures overcoming things , it just needs to be about women in general getting the opportunity to play a multitude of roles , telling a multitude of stories - just to express human experience from a woman 's perspective . I hope , someday , we can get to that point . I 'm all about representation .
ENTP	There 's probably no experience more alienating than fame , other than a terminal illness , where you actually find yourself in a situation that nobody around you can relate to .
ENTP	One nice thing about being a woman in Hollywood is that the women tend to be very close-knit . All of us writers and directors know each other and cling to each other for safety and support , and it 's really a completely different vibe than the men experience out here , where they 're all trying to murder each other .
ESFP	So I 've seen life as one long learning process . And if I see - you know , if I fly on somebody else 's airline and find the experience is not a pleasant one , which it was n't in - 21 years ago , then I 'd think , well , you know , maybe I can create the kind of airline that I 'd like to fly on .
ISTP	I just think that the collective experience of going to see a film is something you ca n't recreate .
INFJ	I discovered early on that some performers live their life in order to act , so all their relationships are simply an experience that they can feed back into their work . Which I find vampiric .
INFJ	If you 've got a piece and you can feel the person who 's going to direct it is really made for it , if it 's really special for them , then it 's going to be a better-than-usual experience .
ISFJ	Obviously an actor draws on his own experience .
ENTP	I really do love Diana Ross I grew up listening to her records . I grew up in a little town in Mexico , so while we got the music , we never got the experience of watching her .
INTP	The monsters of our childhood do not fade away , neither are they ever wholly monstrous . But neither , in my experience , do we ever reach a plane of detachment regarding our parents , however wise and old we may become . To pretend otherwise is to cheat .
INTP	A spy , like a writer , lives outside the mainstream population . He steals his experience through bribes and reconstructs it .
ISTJ	We see our customers as invited guests to a party , and we are the hosts . It 's our job every day to make every important aspect of the customer experience a little bit better .
ISTJ	Prudence is but experience , which equal time , equally bestows on all men , in those things they equally apply themselves unto .
ESFJ	When you go to the movies with your whole family , it 's a different experience . For some reason , it 's something that you 're all doing together and you take away something special in that .
ESTJ	All of the legal defense funds out there , they 're looking for people out there with court of appeals experience , because court of appeals is where policy is made . And I know , I know this is on tape and I should never say that because we do n't make law , I know . I know .
ISTP	I have relationships with people I 'm working with , based on our combined interest . It does n't make the relationship any less sincere , but it does give it a focus that may not last beyond the experience .
ISFP	Every day is a new experience and I take it as it comes .
INFJ	I 'm not particularly precious about the theatrical experience any more .
INFJ	A lot of why I do something is just the novelty of the experience .
INFP	You can live your whole life in your brain and not experience what 's around you . You go crazy that way .
ISFJ	I would n't say I 'm a very original thinker , but if I have a good experience with something , I 'll want to take it further or adapt it in some way .
INTP	I was quite able at the insignificant work I did in MI6 , but absolutely dysfunctional in my domestic life . I had no experience of fatherhood . I had no example of marital bliss or the family unit .
ESTJ	I learn from experience .
ISTP	I have the ordinary experience of being anonymous when I 'm in an airplane talking to air-traffic control , and they do n't know who they 're talking to . I have a lot of common experiences .
ESFJ	I definitely feel more complete than before . There 's a void you have when you do n't feel you 've found the other part of who you are , so I 'm in a different place now and that 's nice to experience .
INTJ	While I was trying to save money to go to the National Institute of Dramatic Art in Australia I ended up getting all of this experience which meant that by the time I had enough money in the bank to go to school I did n't really need to go to school anymore .
ENFP	I think experience will teach you a combination of liberalism and conservatism . We have to be progressive and at the same time we have to retain values . We have to hold onto the past as we explore the future .
ENFP	I would vote for the man who 's lived life , who 's done different occupations , who 's been out in the real world and struggled to make a living , struggled to raise a family , struggled with life as it exists . So I 'd vote for experience , honest experience .
ENFP	There are more people than you think who want to have a challenging experience , in which they are obliged to reflect about the past .
INFJ	I think that the mark of a great book is that it will meet you wherever you 're at and you 'll feel and experience something new and different each time you read it .
INFJ	Well , I stopped drinking . That was actually a big deal . I did n't go through any harrowing rock-bottom experience . I just made a decision to stop drinking .
ESFP	I think most artists will experience a lot of negative people on Twitter but , thank God , I 've got so many followers that I 'm not able to see them that much . I 'll see some from time to time but , for the most part , I always focus on something good .
INFP	I 've had a great experience with pretty much everybody I 've worked with .
ISTJ	From this experience we have learned that in a big party it is important to have the necessary and often controversial discussions on policy issues such as the health system while in opposition .
ENTP	But I just know from experience that accent wise , even if you 're an accent genius , crossing the Atlantic is the hardest thing in the world either way .
ISFJ	On the one hand , we 'll never experience childbirth . On the other hand , we can open all our own jars .
INFJ	My advice would be to write what is most personal and specific to your experience or your life . And your voice will emerge and because of its specificity , it will be universal .
ESFJ	I will perform My Heart Will Go On for the rest of my life and it will always remain a very emotional experience for me .
ISFP	I love music , and after my first experience with movies , I ca n't wait to do more .
ESTP	Far better is it to dare mighty things , to win glorious triumphs , even though checkered by failure ... than to rank with those poor spirits who neither enjoy nor suffer much , because they live in a gray twilight that knows not victory nor defeat .
INTP	My great concern is not whether you have failed , but whether you are content with your failure .

ENFP	Ambition is the last refuge of the failure .
ESFJ	Success is the result of perfection , hard work , learning from failure , loyalty , and persistence .

ESFP	There is no such thing as failure . There are only results .
ISTP	If you 're not failing every now and again , it 's a sign you 're not doing anything very innovative .
ESFP	I think you can have 10,000 explanations for failure , but no good explanation for success .

ESFP	Do not be embarrassed by your failures , learn from them and start again .
ENTP	Failure is always an option .
ESTP	Socialism is a philosophy of failure , the creed of ignorance , and the gospel of envy , its inherent virtue is the equal sharing of misery .

ESTP	Develop success from failures . Discouragement and failure are two of the surest stepping stones to success .
ESTJ	Failure is simply the opportunity to begin again , this time more intelligently .
ESFJ	Leadership is solving problems . The day soldiers stop bringing you their problems is the day you have stopped leading them . They have either lost confidence that you can help or concluded you do not care . Either case is a failure of leadership .
ENTP	The fact that we are here today to debate raising America 's debt limit is a sign of leadership failure . America has a debt problem and a failure of leadership . Americans deserve better . I , therefore , intend to oppose the effort to increase America 's debt .
ENFJ	Think like a queen . A queen is not afraid to fail . Failure is another steppingstone to greatness .
ENTP	In America , there 's a failure to appreciate Europe 's leading role in the world .

INTJ	Failure is not an option . Everyone has to succeed .
INTJ	All human actions are equivalent and all are on principle doomed to failure .

INFP	Who I am as a guitarist is defined by my failure to become Jimi Hendrix .
ESFP	There 's no right or wrong , success or failure .
ENFP	We need to accept that we wo n't always make the right decisions , that we 'll screw up royally sometimes - understanding that failure is not the opposite of success , it 's part of success .
ESTP	Without failure there is no sweetness in success . There 's no understanding of it .
ISTP	I mean , I love L.A. - I love living here . But I wish that we could make things without the need to hit a home run every single time . It 's a unique thing to Hollywood that if you do n't do that every time , then you 're considered a failure . But it 's like , 'Well , are you making movies to be successful ? Or are you making movies to learn something ? '
ISTP	I mean , I love L.A. - I love living here . But I wish that we could make things without the need to hit a home run every single time . It 's a unique thing to Hollywood that if you do n't do that every time , then you 're considered a failure .
ENTJ	The only failure is not to try .
INFJ	I do n't understand a way to work other than bold-facedly running towards failure .
ENTJ	If we do n't succeed , we run the risk of failure .
ISFP	I realized that I was afraid to really , really try something , 100 % , because I had never reached true failure .
ENTJ	What is more comforting to the terrorists around the world : the failure to pass the 9/11 legislation because we lacked 'a majority of the majority , ' or putting aside partisan politics to enact tough new legislation with America 's security foremost in mind ?
ENFJ	Even as far back as when I started acting at 14 , I know I 've never considered failure .
ESTJ	If you 're not a born-again Christian , you 're a failure as a human being .

INFJ	Faith ... must be enforced by reason ... when faith becomes blind it dies .
ENTP	My family , frankly , they were n't folks who went to church every week . My mother was one of the most spiritual people I knew but she did n't raise me in the church , so I came to my Christian faith later in life and it was because the precepts of Jesus Christ spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that I would want to lead .
INFP	Faith , there hath been many great men that have flattered the people who ne'er loved them .
INFJ	But for my faith in God , I should have been a raving maniac .
INFJ	Nonviolence is the first article of my faith . It is also the last article of my creed .

INTP	Faith is the great cop-out , the great excuse to evade the need to think and evaluate evidence . Faith is belief in spite of , even perhaps because of , the lack of evidence .
ENFP	To have faith is to trust yourself to the water . When you swim you do n't grab hold of the water , because if you do you will sink and drown . Instead you relax , and float .
INTJ	Anyone who is to find Christ must first find the church . How could anyone know where Christ is and what faith is in him unless he knew where his believers are ?
ISFJ	Christianity is not the faith of the complacent , the comfortable or of the timid . It demands and creates heroic souls like Wesley , Wilberforce , Bonhoeffer , John Paul the Second , and Billy Graham . Each showed , in their own way , the relentless and powerful influence of the message of Jesus Christ .
ISTP	It 's not the tools that you have faith in - tools are just tools . They work , or they do n't work . It 's people you have faith in or not . Yeah , sure , I 'm still optimistic I mean , I get pessimistic sometimes but not for long .
INTJ	Faith must trample under foot all reason , sense , and understanding .
ISTP	It 's not a faith in technology . It 's faith in people .
INFP	To insure the adoration of a theorem for any length of time , faith is not enough , a police force is needed as well .

ENTP	You know , my faith is one that admits some doubt .
ENTP	What I think is fair to say is that , coming out of the Republican camp , there have been efforts to suggest that perhaps I 'm not who I say I am when it comes to my faith - something which I find deeply offensive , and that has been going on for a pretty long time .

INTJ	Faith is permitting ourselves to be seized by the things we do not see .
INTJ	Reason is the enemy of faith .
ISFJ	It strikes me as odd that the free exercise of religious faith is sometimes treated as a problem , something America is stuck with instead of blessed with .
ENFJ	Only the person who has faith in himself is able to be faithful to others .
INTP	The meme for blind faith secures its own perpetuation by the simple unconscious expedient of discouraging rational inquiry .
ISFJ	No person I have ever met , not even the most righteous or pure of heart , has gone without those times when faith recedes in the busy-ness of life .
ISFJ	This President takes his inspiration from the capitals of Europe we look to the cities and small towns of America . This President puts his faith in government . We put our faith in the American people .

ISTJ	There is nothing wrong with America that faith , love of freedom , intelligence , and energy of her citizens can not cure .
INTP	If children understand that beliefs should be substantiated with evidence , as opposed to tradition , authority , revelation or faith , they will automatically work out for themselves that they are atheists .
ENFP	In other words , a person who is fanatic in matters of religion , and clings to certain ideas about the nature of God and the universe , becomes a person who has no faith at all .
ESTP	No lover , if he be of good faith , and sincere , will deny he would prefer to see his mistress dead than unfaithful .

ISTJ	Only our individual faith in freedom can keep us free .
ESTP	A better world shall emerge based on faith and understanding .
ENFP	Faith is a state of openness or trust .
ESTP	Do I think faith will be an important part of being a good president ? Yes , I do .
ENFP	Faith is part of who I am , yes . I was raised Christian Scientist . The most important thing I saw every single week on the wall at Sunday school was the Golden Rule .
INTP	Faith is not believing that God can . It is knowing that God will .
INTP	At least the fundamentalists have n't tried to dilute their message . Their faith is exposed for what it is for all to see .
ESTP	Faith crosses every border and touches every heart in every nation .
ESFP	I never really had the classic struggle . I had faith .
ENTJ	If I advocate cautious optimism it is not because I do not have faith in the future but because I do not want to encourage blind faith .
INTJ	Religion is part of the human make-up . It 's also part of our cultural and intellectual history . Religion was our first attempt at literature , the texts , our first attempt at cosmology , making sense of where we are in the universe , our first attempt at health care , believing in faith healing , our first attempt at philosophy .
ESTP	Our society is illuminated by the spiritual insights of the Hebrew prophets . America and Israel have a common love of human freedom , and they have a common faith in a democratic way of life .
ESTP	The separation of church and state is a source of strength , but the conscience of our nation does not call for separation between men of state and faith in the Supreme Being .
ESFP	It 's very important that every movie I do makes money because I want the people that had the faith in me to get their money back .
INFJ	Let judges secretly despair of justice : their verdicts will be more acute . Let generals secretly despair of triumph killing will be defamed . Let priests secretly despair of faith : their compassion will be true .
ISFJ	I do n't think that the total creation took place in six days as we now measure time . If we can confirm , say , the Big Bang theory , that does n't at all cause me to question my faith that God created the Big Bang .

INTJ	There 's been some research in cognitive science , I 'm told , that discloses that there have always been perhaps 10 to 15 percent of people who are , as Pascal puts it , so made that they can not believe . To us , when people talk about faith , it 's white noise .
INFP	Base souls have no faith in great individuals .
ESTP	Between understanding and faith immediate connections must subsist .
ISFJ	I think there ought to be a strict separation or wall built between our religious faith and our practice of political authority in office . I do n't think the President of the United States should extoll Christianity if he happens to be a Christian at the expense of Judaism , Islam or other faiths .
ESFP	My faith helps me understand that circumstances do n't dictate my happiness , my inner peace .
ESTP	Faith Hill is a big role model .
ISFJ	You just have to have a simple faith .
ISFJ	In religious and in secular affairs , the more fervent beliefs attract followers . If you are a moderate in any respect - if you 're a moderate on abortion , if you 're a moderate on gun control , or if you 're a moderate in your religious faith - it does n't evolve into a crusade where you 're either right or wrong , good or bad , with us or against us .
INFP	I do n't know if the average person really has faith in Washington anymore .
ENFP	I 've always thought that as long as directors and casting directors do n't see me as just Harry Potter , I 'll be OK. People have shown a lot of faith in me , and I owe them a huge debt . They 're letting me prove that I 'm serious about this .
ESFP	I have always been the kid who 's asked 'Why ? ' In my faith , you 're just supposed to have faith . But I was always like 'why ? '
ISTJ	The Christian faith can never be separated from the soil of sacred events , from the choice made by God , who wanted to speak to us , to become man , to die and rise again , in a particular place and at a particular time .
ESTP	Let me go over this again on the reclaiming the civil rights movement . People of faith that believe that you have an equal right to justice - that is the essence . And if it 's not the essence , then we 've been sold a pack of lies . The essence is everyone deserves a shot - the content of character , not the color of skin .
ESFP	But I do n't necessarily define my faith by going to church every Sunday .
ISFP	I just sort of take it from a character perspective , and I do n't know if he was necessarily spiritual , but I do think he had hope . He was a character that was comfortable having hope in his life , and hope is faith .
ESFJ	My gut feeling about sequels is that they should be premeditated : You should try to write a trilogy first or at least sketch out a trilogy if you have any faith in your film .
ENFJ	My faith foundation works to bring about a greater respect and understanding between different faiths . We basically work with six popular religions in the world which are the three Abrahamic religions , Hinduism and Buddhism and Sikhism .
ISTJ	Laughter kills fear , and without fear there can be no faith . For without fear of the devil there is no need for God .
ESTP	All an actor has is their blind faith that they are who they say they are today , in any scene .
ENTJ	I have faith in the United States and our ability to make good decisions based on the facts .
INFJ	I have this embedded faith in the process through which films of a certain type get discovered on longer timelines .
ISTJ	The abuse of faith has to be resisted precisely .
ESFJ	Earmarks have become a symbol of a Congress that has broken faith with the people . This earmark ban shows the American people we are listening and we are dead serious about ending business as usual in Washington .
ESTJ	President Obama and his radical feminist enforcers have had it in for Catholic medical providers from the get-go . It 's about time all people of faith fought back against this unprecedented encroachment on religious liberty . First , they came for the Catholics . Who 's next ?
ESTJ	I think the Moslem faith teaches hate .
ESTJ	I have faith in the jury system .
ISFP	Family is the most important thing in the world .
ESFJ	You do n't choose your family . They are God 's gift to you , as you are to them .
ISFJ	America can not continue to lead the family of nations around the world if we suffer the collapse of the family here at home .
ESTP	First and foremost comes my family and my life with Brad . We have so much joy in raising our children and teaching them about the world that nothing really compares to that .
ESTJ	When you have a godly husband , a godly wife , children who respect their parents and who are loved by their parents , who provide for those children their physical and spiritual and material needs , lovingly , you have the ideal unit .
ISFP	What must it be like for a little boy to read that daddy never loved mummy ?
ESFJ	My kids give me the balance to live right .
ENFP	There is no such thing as fun for the whole family .
INTP	I have frequently been questioned , especially by women , of how I could reconcile family life with a scientific career . Well , it has not been easy .
ISFP	A family is a risky venture , because the greater the love , the greater the loss ... That 's the trade-off . But I 'll take it all .
ESFP	A woman should be home with the children , building that home and making sure there 's a secure family atmosphere .
ENFP	At a certain point I 'm going to want to have a family .
ESFJ	We 'll sort of get over the marriage first and then maybe look at the kids . But obviously we want a family so we 'll have to start thinking about that .
ENTJ	I love children and I get along with them great . It 's just that I believe if you 're going to be a parent , there has to be something inside you that says , 'I want a family . ' I do n't feel that sense of urgency .
ESFJ	I do n't know if I believe in marriage . I believe in family , love and children .
ENTP	It was the labor movement that helped secure so much of what we take for granted today . The 40-hour work week , the minimum wage , family leave , health insurance , Social Security , Medicare , retirement plans . The cornerstones of the middle-class security all bear the union label .
ENFP	Fathers should be neither seen nor heard . That is the only proper basis for family life .
ENTP	He that raises a large family does , indeed , while he lives to observe them , stand a broader mark for sorrow but then he stands a broader mark for pleasure too .
ENFP	The other night I ate at a real nice family restaurant . Every table had an argument going .
ENTP	I can make a firm pledge , under my plan , no family making less than $ 250,000 a year will see any form of tax increase . Not your income tax , not your payroll tax , not your capital gains taxes , not any of your taxes .
ISFP	The details surrounding both my marriage and subsequent filing for divorce are private , and I had hoped to keep them that way for the sake of my family .
ISFJ	All the laws and legislation in the world will never heal this world like the loving hearts and arms of mothers and fathers . If every child could drift to sleep feeling wrapped in the love of their family - and God 's love - this world would be a far more gentle and better place .
ENTP	But let me perfectly clear , because I know you 'll hear the same old claims that rolling back these tax breaks means a massive tax increase on the American people : if your family earns less than $ 250,000 a year , you will not see your taxes increased a single dime . I repeat : not one single dime .
ENFJ	I am confident that nobody ... will accuse me of selfishness if I ask to spend time , while I am still in good health , with my family , my friends and also with myself .
ISFJ	In the richest country in the history of the world , this Obama economy has crushed the middle class . Family income has fallen by $ 4,000 , but health insurance premiums are higher , food prices are higher , utility bills are higher , and gasoline prices have doubled . Today more Americans wake up in poverty than ever before .
ENFP	We believed in our idea - a family park where parents and children could have fun- together .
ENTP	I have Muslim members of my family . I have lived in Muslim countries .
INFP	I was angry and frustrated until I started my own family and my first child was born . Until then I did n't really appreciate life the way I should have , but fortunately I woke up .
ESTJ	My mother 's love has always been a sustaining force for our family , and one of my greatest joys is seeing her integrity , her compassion , her intelligence reflected in my daughters .
ISFJ	Now is the moment when we can stand up and say , 'I 'm an American . I make my destiny . And we deserve better ! My children deserve better ! My family deserves better . My country deserves better ! ' So here we stand . Americans have a choice .
ISFJ	The promise of America has always been that if you worked hard , had the right values , took some risks , that there was an opportunity to build a better life for your family and for your next generation .
ISFJ	President Obama promised to begin to slow the rise of the oceans and heal the planet . My promise ... is to help you and your family .
ESTJ	You can not have maternal health without reproductive health . And reproductive health includes contraception and family planning and access to legal , safe abortion .
INFP	A family with the wrong members in control that , perhaps , is as near as one can come to describing England in a phrase .
ENFP	Where would you be without friends ? The people to pick you up when you need lifting ? We come from homes far from perfect , so you end up almost parent and sibling to your friends - your own chosen family . There 's nothing like a really loyal , dependable , good friend . Nothing .
ESTJ	In my family , we were Americans , we were Republicans and we were Methodists .
INTJ	I believe with all my heart that America remains 'the great idea ' that inspires the world . It is a privilege to be born here . It is an honor to become a citizen here . It is a gift to raise your family here , to vote here , and to live here .
INTJ	My work and my family are very important to me .
INTJ	Everything I have , my career , my success , my family , I owe to America .
ISFP	It 's hard knowing who to trust with your personal life . When you cry in your room at night , you do n't always know who to call . So I am very close to my family .
INTJ	Think about what people are doing on Facebook today . They 're keeping up with their friends and family , but they 're also building an image and identity for themselves , which in a sense is their brand . They 're connecting with the audience that they want to connect to . It 's almost a disadvantage if you 're not on it now .
INTJ	I had this child , and it destroyed my family .
ESFJ	The God who existed before any religion counts on you to make the oneness of the human family known and celebrated .
ISFJ	The virtue of privacy is one that must be protected in matters that are intimate and within one 's own family .
ESFJ	God 's dream is that you and I and all of us will realize that we are family , that we are made for togetherness , for goodness , and for compassion .
ENFJ	In the investigation of a neurotic style of life , we must always suspect an opponent , and note who suffers most because of the patient 's condition . Usually this is a member of the family .
ESFP	I can not remember a moment in my life when I have not felt the love of my family . We were a family that would have killed for each other - and we still are .
ESFJ	In God 's family , there are no outsiders , no enemies .
ISFJ	Everything family does is reflection on the other people .
ISFJ	My mother has always been the social glue holding the family together .
ISFJ	I always put clothes and family photos under the mattress , in case the house burns down .
ESTJ	We will see a breakdown of the family and family values if we decide to approve same-sex marriage , and if we decide to establish homosexuality as an acceptable alternative lifestyle with all the benefits that go with equating it with the heterosexual lifestyle .
ISFP	Leave the matter of religion to the family altar , the church , and the private school , supported entirely by private contributions . Keep the church and state forever separate .
ISFP	I 've made all my money on my own without my family and I work very hard .
ISFP	I guess you could say I devoted myself so strongly to my music that for awhile I forgot about my family . But I only get one set of parents , and I think I forgot about that for a little while .
ESFP	It all starts with the script : it 's not worth taking myself away from my family if I do n't have something I 'm really passionate about .
ISFP	There 's a schizoid streak within the family anyway so I dare say that I 'm affected by that . The majority of the people in my family have been in some kind of mental institution , as for my brother he does n't want to leave . He likes it very much .
ISTP	Let your family , staff , and friends know that you 're still the same person , despite all the publicity and notoriety that accompanies your position .
ENFP	I realised how paranoid and guarded and not trusting - walled-in - I had become . Not consciously so , but just this armour that I kind of have , protective armour . It 's not for my friends or family , but for being.outside in the world , always on guard .
ESTJ	Together , we can help make sure that every family that walks into a restaurant can make an easy , healthy choice .
INTJ	And when I was young , my family was perfectly nice . I write a lot about it , as you noticed . But it was rather limited . I think , I do n't think anyone in my family would really feel I 'd done them an injustice by saying that . We did n't see many people . There were many books . It was as if I wanted to get away from home .
ISFP	I just want my family to be safe . Because I am sometimes polarizing , I fear for their safety .
ENTJ	In five years ' time I 'd like to be a mum . I want to settle down and have a family , definitely sooner rather than later . I 'd like to have finished my second album too , maybe even my third . I 'd like a sound that sticks around that other people are inspired by and that people know is me .
ESFP	The only people that you really have , that I learned , are your family , because they love you no matter what .
ESFJ	Protecting the institution of marriage safeguards , I believe , the American family .
ESTP	I know I 'm talented , but I was n't put here to sing . I was put here to be a wife and a mom and look after my family . I love what I do , but it 's not where it begins and ends .
ESTJ	I came from a poor family , so working and going to school at the same time was natural . It taught me multi-tasking , although we did n't call it that back then . I learned I could never be idle , I need to be doing many things at once .
ENFP	When you look at Prince Charles , do n't you think that someone in the Royal family knew someone in the Royal family ?
ENTP	I do n't see how the party that says it 's the party of the family is going to adopt an immigration policy which destroys families that have been here a quarter century .
ISFP	Being a Barrymore did n't help me , other than giving me a great sense of pride and a strange spiritual sense that I felt OK about having the passion to act . It made sense because my whole family had done it and it helped rationalise it for me .
ISFP	I grew up in a family that was multifaceted , sexually oriented , and pretty much open to everything . And because I was working , my friends were all adults . I had a tough time going to different schools because people knew me from films and I was the fat child who got beaten up every day .
ISFP	I really have created a family . I work with the people I love , I travel with them , I make films with them , and I 'm in an office with them . So in a weird way - I know I have n't birthed a child - I feel that I 'm a part of creating a family . It 's a tribe . I love that word .
ISFP	When I did 'E.T. , ' it sort of solidified the only family I know are these film crews . These gypsies . These filmmakers . That was the solidification and the clicking revelations of 'This is what I want to do with my life and this is where I 'm going to survive . '
ISFJ	As a child , the family that I had and the love I had from my two parents allowed me to go ahead and be more aggressive , to search and to take risks knowing that , if I failed , I could always come home to a family of love and support .
ISFJ	I have let my family down and I regret those transgressions with all of my heart .
INFJ	It is awesome to feel you are carrying on the family name .
ESTP	My family really does come first . It always did and always will .
ESFP	I come from a very non-accepting family , but I 'm very accepting .
ESTP	When you live in an alcoholic family or an abusive family , you tiptoe , you do n't want to step on any mines .
ESFJ	My parents were drawn to the idea that there was space and opportunity in Australia . For the meagre sum of & pound10 , you could sail your entire family out to Australia , so that 's what my father chose to do .
ISFJ	Personal sins should not require press releases and problems within a family should n't have to mean public confessions .
ISFJ	I have not been true to my values and the behavior my family deserves .
ISFJ	I hurt my wife , my kids , my mother , my wife 's family , my friends , my foundation and kids all around the world who admired me .
ESFP	My ultimate life dream project is my kids . My family .
ENTP	I ca n't tell you how scary it can be walking onto a movie and suddenly joining this family , it 's like going to somebody else 's Christmas dinner , everyone knows everyone , and you 're there and you 're not quite sure what you 're supposed to be doing .
ISFP	I 'm a strong person , I 'm a strong family man , I 'm a strong husband and a strong father .
ENTJ	My mom has made it possible for me to be who I am . Our family is everything . Her greatest skill was encouraging me to find my own person and own independence .
ESFP	Acting is just a way of making a living , the family is life .
ESFP	Santa Barbara is my hood . I mean , it 's not much of a hood , but it is definitely like my hood . I claim Santa Barbara like I claim my family . I 'm going to be married and buried there .
ISFJ	I hate the way they portray us in the media . If you see a black family it says they 're looting , if you see a white family it says they 're looking for food .
ESFJ	I do not see my family life in any way , shape , or form as an opportunity for a photo .
ISFP	Stay out of the sun , because it is the worst thing in terms of aging . I 'm very medical . I come from a medical family .
ENTJ	If you do n't have public hangings for bad culture in a company , if you do n't take people out and let them say , they went home to spend more time with the family . It 's crazy .
ISTJ	Young actors often do n't think of the consequences of doing nudity or sex scenes . They want the role so badly that they agree to be exploited , and then end up embarrassing family , friends , and even strangers .
ENFP	You do n't have to give birth to someone to have a family .
ESTP	By the time I was 30 , nobody would work with me . I was friendless , I was hopeless , I was suicidal , lost my family - I mean , it was bad . Bottomed out , did n't know what I was going to do . I actually thought I was going to be a chef - go to work in a kitchen someplace .
ISFJ	If you see a black family , it 's looting , but if it 's a white family they are looking for food .
ISTP	I 'm not ready to get married , but I have a pretty great family and I 'd like that too , someday .
ISTP	I have a great family by the way , but you need to find people who can pull something out from you that might be otherwise unseen .
ENTJ	A family is very special . So when a family splits up , it 's not good , it 's never good .
ISFP	I grew up in a family of strong women and I owe any capacity I have to understand women to my mother and big sister . They taught me to respect women in a way where I 've always felt a strong emotional connection to women , which has also helped me in the way I approach my work as an actor .
ENFP	My priorities are always going to be my husband and my family now . That 's a huge , huge thing .
ESTP	There 's no road map on how to raise a family : it 's always an enormous negotiation .
ISFJ	My family is my life , and I 'll never lose that .
ESFJ	I guess now that I think back , I used to play priest and be a funny priest . I do n't know , I grew up in such a Catholic family that I kind of liked to test the boundaries a little bit and I think I had fun watching my mom laugh .
INTP	I do all of the grocery shopping in my little family . I buy cheese , of many different kinds , sliced packaged meats and poultry , bagels , immense quantities of eggs , pre-made fried chicken . Milk . Bacon . It is insane how much dairy , deli and bakery stuff I buy .
ESFJ	I have a mother that 's very strong and family that surround me and constantly tell me they love me .
ESTP	I 'm happiest with my family around me .
ESTP	All the songs I write are about human dynamics , whether it 's with girlfriends , boyfriends , or family .
ISTP	My family and friends treat me as they always have .
INFP	How do you rebel in a family of rebels ?
ENTP	At one point in my life , I was very involved with social causes . I 'm still involved , but now I have a family and it 's important to me .
ENTP	I have one friend that I 've had since I was born , and she 's from Coatzacoalcos . She 's not really impressed or interested in the actor 's life . My family is n't really either .
ISTP	I 'm an actor I 'm not a politician . I always kick myself when I talk too much about family , or personal things .
ESFJ	I was the oldest of the children in my family . I had to do a lot of diaper-changing and lunch-making . I was taking my little sister to ballet , picking up my brother , sort of being a super-nanny .
ESFP	I 'm thinking of a legacy that I can be proud of and wealth that my grandchildren can use to go to college . So world domination - in terms of providing for my family - is absolutely my goal .
ESFP	My rule is , whatever you were calling me four years ago is what you should be calling me now , because I do n't like it when my family or close friends call me Nicki Minaj . To me I 'm not Nicki Minaj when I 'm with them .
INFP	I always wanted to be a farmer . There is a tradition of that in my family .
INFP	Anyone that has a job that takes them away from home , I think , can understand the difficulties in maintaining consistency , not only with your family and those you love but with your friends .
ESTJ	God created the family to provide the maximum love and support and morality and example that one can imagine .
INFP	It 's a family that 's loaded with grudges and passion . We come from a long line of robbers and highwaymen in Italy , you know . Killers , even .
ENTJ	Of course I regret not having been able to spend time with my family .
ENTJ	One wants to be together with one 's family . That 's what families are about .
INTJ	Some of the things you read you get an immediate reaction to so I 've stopped reading things now . I do worry about my family though . Some people do try some nasty things to get at them and try and get a reaction from them .
INFJ	Anybody who is running a marathon or doing a walkathon , doing a fundraiser for their school , their company , by far it 's guaranteed the easiest and most fun way to quickly set up a fundraising campaign and send it around to your friends and family .
ESTP	I went through a period of great rebellion within my family , when I was about 9 or 10 . I was mad , I had no focus , had no real interest in anything , and so I started to do things that were just rebellious and stupid .
ENFP	My mom always said I was the peacemaker in the family . My older brother , Eric , was the leader , the creative one . I was just his puppet .
ENFP	Finding that balance between work and family is the hardest thing I 've ever done - by far .
ISTP	When I heard the royal family wanted to have me perform in celebration of Prince William 's marriage , I knew I had to give them a little something . 'Wet ' is the perfect anthem for Prince William or any playa to get the club smokin ' .
ESFJ	Touring is tough . You 're almost in a haze because you do n't really know where you are half the time : You 're in a hotel room one moment , and the next thing you know , you 're onstage performing for 60,000 people , then you 're back on an airplane . It 's very hectic and I could n't do it without my family .
ESTJ	My mother isolated herself from all family and friends for some 20 years . And never met her grandchild , my son .
INFP	I love seeing my family .
ISFJ	I love film . After a yummy meal for the whole family and some truly great friends , we often go out to see something beautiful and unique .
INTP	You have no idea how humiliating it was , as a boy , to suddenly have all your clothes , your toys , snatched by the bailiff . I mean we were a middle-class family , it 's not as if it was happening up and down the street . It made me ashamed , I felt dirty .
ESFJ	I 'm very , very concerned about the Bush presidency . I 'm worried about the kinds of cuts in domestic programs that mean something to a lot of people , including members of my family , who depend on certain things from the government .
ESFJ	I have a lot of responsibilities outside myself . I have a large family . I want to know I can always be helpful .
ENTJ	I 've always known I wanted a family .
INFP	Everyone will be famous for 15 minutes .
ENFP	I have no use for people who throw their weight around as celebrities , or for those who fawn over you just because you are famous .
ENTP	What a heavy burden is a name that has become too famous .
ENTJ	I just want to make music , I do n't want people to talk about me . All I 've ever wanted to do was sing . I do n't want to be a celebrity . I do n't want to be in people 's faces , you know , constantly on covers of magazine that I have n't even known I 'm on .
INFJ	I wanted to be successful , not famous .
INFP	How many famous and high-spirited heroes have lived a day too long ?
ISFP	Tom Cruise , he 's a lot more famous than me .
INFJ	The hardest thing about being famous is that people are always nice to you . You 're in a conversation and everybody 's agreeing with what you 're saying - even if you say something totally crazy . You need people who can tell you what you do n't want to hear .
ENTP	But I know newspapers . They have the first amendment and they can tell any lie knowing it 's a lie and they 're protected if the person 's famous or it 's a company .
ESTJ	Public misbehavior by the famous is a powerful teaching tool .
ISFP	I think that when you are famous every weakness is exaggerated .
ISFP	Before I was famous , when I was just working in Gilbert 's Lodge , everything was moving in slow motion .
INFP	To be famous , in fact , one has only to kill one 's landlady .
ENTJ	When I started out , I did n't have any desire to be an actress or to learn how to act . I just wanted to be famous .
INFP	I 'm bored with that line . I never use it anymore . My new line is 'In 15 minutes everybody will be famous . '
ISFP	I do n't like Los Angeles . The people are awful and terribly shallow , and everybody wants to be famous but nobody wants to play the game . I 'm from New York . I will kill to get what I need .
INFP	My idea of a good picture is one that 's in focus and of a famous person .
INFP	In the future everyone will be famous for 15 minutes .
ENFP	When we were growing up our parents somehow made it clear that being famous was good . And I mistakenly thought that if I was famous then everyone would love me .
ISFJ	There 's more pressure to be famous for being yourself than if you 're being a character .
ISFP	What I 've learned is that you really do n't need to be a celebrity or have money or have the paparazzi following you around to be famous .
ENFP	I 've never sat there and plotted out how I was going to become successful or famous .
ENFP	It 's interesting because people assume that because I 'm famous I know all famous people .
ESFJ	I 'm doing a new musical on Broadway , which opens in October called 'The Boy from Oz , ' where I play Peter Allen . For those of you who do n't know , he became first famous in America for marrying Liza Minelli .
ENFP	There were a few years there when I was just so enamored with the idea of living some sort of famous person 's lifestyle that really is n't suited to me .
ENFP	I think it 's useful , as a famous person , to have as little separation between the perception of you and how you really are - because otherwise I 'd be sitting here thinking I 'm keeping secrets , and wondering when you 're going to find out .
ESFJ	I made my living being 20 or 30 pounds heavier than the average model . And that 's where I got famous .
ISTP	The strangest part about being famous is you do n't get to give first impressions anymore . Everyone already has an impression of you before you meet them .
ISFJ	I have no interest in Shakespeare and all that British nonsense ... I just wanted to get famous and all the rest is hogwash .
ESFJ	I certainly do n't think you need to be famous to want to leave a legacy , but when you are famous , it 's even more likely that your child will get the wrong perspective on your life if you die prematurely .
ESTP	People just assume that if you 're famous , you 're in Hollywood .
ISTJ	Look at Jessica Simpson . She 's famous for being dumb . I guess it started with Marylyn Monroe , and she actually was n't that dumb , but that 's how she was perceived - and that 's what got popular .
ENFJ	Because you know when you first become famous , you start walking a little different because people are staring at you .
ENFJ	Famous people come up to me , but I do n't know who they are because my sight is so bad . It 's always at the pool of the Four Seasons in Beverly Hills when I do n't have my lenses in and my glasses are in my room .
ISFP	The worst thing about being famous is the invasion of your privacy .
ENTP	You know , I did not like being famous . It was a stressful and ugly time , and I 'm glad it 's over .
ENTP	To enjoy being famous , you need to have a screw loose .
ISTP	I would have been very happy just working from job to job , paying my rent one movie at a time . I never wanted to be this famous . I never imagined this life for myself .
INFP	I 'm willing to make compromises based on someone I think is the one , but I think it 's psychologically important to people when they 're famous to be the only famous person they know .
ISFJ	My hair was famous before I was .
ISTP	I 'm English . Our dentistry is not world famous .
ENFP	As a famous person you think how you 're gon na end it , get away and have a normal life .
ISTJ	There are people who appear in the magazines and I do n't know who they are . I 've never seen anything they 've done and their careers are over already . They 're famous for maybe 10 minutes . Real careers , I think , take a long time to unfold .
ESFJ	I never wanted to be a celebrity I never wanted to be famous . And in my daily life , I work really hard to not trade on it in any way .
ISFP	I do n't have many famous friends , really , except Simon Cowell .
ISFP	Usually when I see someone famous , for some reason , I think I know them .
ISTP	My goal was just to work regularly . I did n't ever expect to be rich or famous . I wanted to be a working character actor .
INFP	There 's the famous thing that the A & ampR man from the record company is supposed to do : He 's supposed to come into the studio and listen to the songs you 've been recording and then say , 'Guys , I do n't hear any singles . ' And then everybody falls into a terrible depression because you have to write one .
INFP	As a shy kid growing up in Sheffield , I fantasized about how it would be great to be famous so I would n't actually have to talk to people and feel awkward . And of course , as we all know from fairy stories , when you achieve that ambition , you find out you do n't want it .
INFP	Pulp existed for 12 years before we got famous . Now , you could say that was just lack of imagination , but it 's some kind of quality is n't it ? Tenacity . You could also say it was sloth .
ENFP	There are a lot of good things about being famous but there are a few not so good things too .
ENTP	I just think Rosa Parks was overrated . Last time I checked , she got famous for breaking the law .
ISFP	I could have been more famous if I did all the glitzy things , but celebrity always seemed so unnecessary .
ISTJ	The hardest thing about being famous is that people are always nice to you .
INFJ	For me , getting comfortable with being famous was hard - that whole side of it , the loss of anonymity , the loss of privacy . Giving up that part of your life and not having control of it .

ENTP	I also want to go to an Italian island and do cuisine properly with some famous Italian chef and , like , his mother .
ISFJ	I 've always had confidence . Before I was famous , that confidence got me into trouble . After I got famous , it just got me into more trouble .

ESTJ	I do n't feel famous .
ENFP	The F-word is 'famous , ' the C-word is 'celebrity ' and S-word is 'star , ' in my book . The other three words are fine - you can say those . But 'famous , ' 'celebrity ' and 'star , ' I think , are misused .
ENFP	I 'd die if I was Madonna . I 'd die . God , what a horrible way to live . And Michael Jackson ! To be so famous and to feel so isolated . I feel so bad for them . I do n't know how it feels , and I hope it never happens to me .
ESFJ	But I do n't feel the need to be famous .
ESFJ	I do n't put weight on fame , and having people around me just because I am famous makes me feel really bad about myself .
INFJ	I want to be in 'Glee , ' but I 'm told I 'm not famous enough to be a cameo yet .
ENTJ	Whereas you have someone like Houdini , who works really , really hard to get really , really famous , and then has actual intellectual ideas that he puts into the culture that stay there .

INFP	All religion , my friend , is simply evolved out of fraud , fear , greed , imagination , and poetry .

INFJ	Fix reason firmly in her seat , and call to her tribunal every fact , every opinion . Question with boldness even the existence of a God because , if there be one , he must more approve of the homage of reason , than that of blindfolded fear .

INFP	In time we hate that which we often fear .

ENTP	On every front there are clear answers out there that can make this country stronger , but we 're going to break through the fear and the frustration people are feeling . Our job is to make sure that even as we make progress , that we are also giving people a sense of hope and vision for the future .
ENFJ	I believe that every single event in life happens in an opportunity to choose love over fear .

ESTP	It is better for you to be free of fear lying upon a pallet , than to have a golden couch and a rich table and be full of trouble .

ISFP	When you 're young , you 're always wondering when you 're actually going to feel like a grownup . And I think you probably fear it , in a sense , too .

INFP	If you have an issue with homosexuality , then it comes to your own fear and your own darkness .

ENFJ	I believe the American people have a genuine and justifiable fear of government intrusion in what they instinctively know is going to be an ever more intrusive world .

ISTJ	My main concern with the condition of mathematics in high school is that there 's a lot of fear involved ! Math is not , generally speaking , presented in a fun way . The concepts , as I see them , are fun , and that 's the way I 'd like to convey them myself .
INFJ	Resistance is feasible even for those who are not heroes by nature , and it is an obligation , I believe , for those who fear the consequences and detest the reality of the attempt to impose American hegemony .

ENFJ	But with the right kind of coaching and determination you can accomplish anything and the biggest accomplishment that I feel I got from the film was overcoming that fear .

ISTP	My only fear is the unknown .
ENTP	For any new technology there is always controversy and there always some fear associated with it . I think that 's just the price of being first sometimes .

ENFP	There 's no love more intense than the love we have for our kids - and where there is intense love , there is also intense fear lurking beneath the surface .

ENFP	People love their animals so much so that they put little clothes on them and necklaces and booties and things like that .

ENTP	I 've always liked Atlanta . And not just for the strip clubs , but the shopping and the food .

ESFJ	If I 'm a lush at anything , it 's food and drink . I 'm not materialistic in any way , but I value food .

ESFJ	I try to eat in a way that makes me feel good . If that means a little bite of chocolate I do that , but I try not to use food as a reward for myself .
ESFP	Just because the Americans are so good at rattling out accessible and cheap junk food , nobody looks twice when it comes to their food . But there are golden nuggets everywhere .
ENFJ	In England and America people tend to graze all day long , but I think it 's such a waste to be constantly picking at food because you then ca n't enjoy a proper full meal when the time comes .
ESFP	All I ever wanted to do was to make food accessible to everyone to show that you can make mistakes - I do all the time - but it does n't matter .
ESFP	It 's very clear that there 's a lot of double standards going on . Should there be a 30mph speed limit ? Of course there bloody should . And certainly with kids and school food , kids need to be nannied for sure . So give them a bloody good meal at school .

ESFP	Heads know that failing to invest in good , nutritious food is a false economy and parents wo n't tolerate reconstituted turkey being put back on the menu .
ESFP	I want Americans to enjoy food . I want them to celebrate food . I want them to , on occasions , to have big cakes and great things . And I want them to indulge .
ESFP	I would n't say that processed food , ready meals and even takeaways are n't relevant to modern life , it 's just that over the past 40 years there are three generations of people who have come out of school and gone through their home life without ever being shown how to cook properly .
ENTP	I get way too much happiness from good food .
ESTJ	They advertise on the radio for food stamps !
ENFJ	I love to cook comfort food . I 'll make fish and vegetables or meat and vegetables and potatoes or rice . The ritual of it is fun for me , and the creativity of it .
ENFP	I think there 's a lot of work to be done with our societies . My biggest passions are the environment and health . And when I say 'health ' I mean the secrets behind health and our food system .
ISTJ	Meat is a big deal in my life . I do love breakfast food , but I do n't think that 's extraordinary . I 'm a normal American . We love eggs and meat and potatoes and gravy .
ISFP	Life excites me-just little , normal , everyday things . Getting out of bed . Getting dressed . Making food . I find it all exciting .
ESFJ	It 's almost seems as though there 's a battle going on between the public and all the fast-food establishments , and , believe me , I think it 's very tasty food .
ENFJ	Darkness can not drive out darkness only light can do that . Hate can not drive out hate only love can do that .
INFJ	The weak can never forgive . Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong .
ESFP	Forgive your enemies , but never forget their names .
ENFP	Always forgive your enemies - nothing annoys them so much .
ENFP	Forgiveness is the fragrance that the violet sheds on the heel that has crushed it .
ENFP	The public is wonderfully tolerant . It forgives everything except genius .
INTJ	If there is something to pardon in everything , there is also something to condemn .
ESTJ	Man has two great spiritual needs . One is for forgiveness . The other is for goodness .
INFP	It is easier to forgive an enemy than to forgive a friend .
INTP	Selfishness must always be forgiven you know , because there is no hope of a cure .
ESFJ	Without forgiveness , there 's no future .
INTP	Forgiveness is the key to action and freedom .
ENTP	I shall be an autocrat , that 's my trade and the good Lord will forgive me , that 's his .
INTJ	Forgiveness is God 's command .
ESFJ	Forgiveness says you are given another chance to make a new beginning .
INFP	The glory of Christianity is to conquer by forgiveness .
ESTJ	Every year during their High Holy Days , the Jewish community reminds us all of our need for repentance and forgiveness .
ENFP	If only I was n't an atheist , I could get away with anything . You 'd just ask for forgiveness and then you 'd be forgiven . It sounds much better than having to live with guilt .
ESFJ	Because forgiveness is like this : a room can be dank because you have closed the windows , you 've closed the curtains . But the sun is shining outside , and the air is fresh outside . In order to get that fresh air , you have to get up and open the window and draw the curtains apart .
ESFJ	Before Nelson Mandela was arrested in 1962 , he was an angry , relatively young man . He founded the ANC 's military wing . When he was released , he surprised everyone because he was talking about reconciliation and forgiveness and not about revenge .
ESTP	I find forgiveness to be really healthy .
ESTJ	On the Day of Atonement , Jews are commanded to seek forgiveness from the people we have hurt .
ESTJ	Well , of course I think people can be forgiven . But our justice system is not set up to dispense forgiveness . You can go to the local priest for that .
ESFP	Freedom prospers when religion is vibrant and the rule of law under God is acknowledged .
ENFJ	For to be free is not merely to cast off one 's chains , but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others .
ISTJ	If you want total security , go to prison . There you 're fed , clothed , given medical care and so on . The only thing lacking ... is freedom .
INFJ	Freedom is not worth having if it does not connote freedom to err .
INFP	Freedom is nothing but a chance to be better .
INTJ	Freedom is what you do with what 's been done to you .
ESTP	The only sure bulwark of continuing liberty is a government strong enough to protect the interests of the people , and a people strong enough and well enough informed to maintain its sovereign control over the goverment .
ESTP	The truth is I love being alive . And I love feeling free . So if I ca n't have those things then I feel like a caged animal and I 'd rather not be in a cage . I 'd rather be dead . And it 's real simple . And I think it 's not that uncommon .
INTJ	Liberty can not be preserved without general knowledge among the people .
ENTP	The only freedom which deserves the name is that of pursuing our own good , in our own way , so long as we do not attempt to deprive others of theirs , or impede their efforts to obtain it .
INTP	I 'm a big advocate of freedom : freedom of speech , freedom of expression , freedom of thought .
ESTP	We will not waver we will not tire we will not falter , and we will not fail . Peace and Freedom will prevail .
ENFP	What is freedom of expression ? Without the freedom to offend , it ceases to exist .
INFJ	Freedom is absolutely necessary for the progress in science and the liberal arts .
ESTP	We 're giving our freedoms away . The American experiment was about freedom . Freedom to be stupid , freedom to fail , freedom to succeed .
INFP	Friends can help each other . A true friend is someone who lets you have total freedom to be yourself - and especially to feel . Or , not feel . Whatever you happen to be feeling at the moment is fine with them . That 's what real love amounts to - letting a person be what he really is .
ESFP	Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction . We did n't pass it to our children in the bloodstream . It must be fought for , protected , and handed on for them to do the same .
INFP	A friend is someone who gives you total freedom to be yourself .
ISTJ	If the freedom of speech is taken away then dumb and silent we may be led , like sheep to the slaughter .
ENFJ	Freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor it must be demanded by the oppressed .
ESTP	All the great things are simple , and many can be expressed in a single word : freedom , justice , honor , duty , mercy , hope .
INFJ	Our greatest happiness does not depend on the condition of life in which chance has placed us , but is always the result of a good conscience , good health , occupation , and freedom in all just pursuits .
INTP	Those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves .
ESFP	The cost of freedom is always high , but Americans have always paid it . And one path we shall never choose , and that is the path of surrender , or submission .
ESFP	Israel was not created in order to disappear - Israel will endure and flourish . It is the child of hope and the home of the brave . It can neither be broken by adversity nor demoralized by success . It carries the shield of democracy and it honors the sword of freedom .
ENFP	It is by the goodness of God that in our country we have those three unspeakably precious things : freedom of speech , freedom of conscience , and the prudence never to practice either of them .
ESFP	Conformity is the jailer of freedom and the enemy of growth .
INFP	The most important kind of freedom is to be what you really are . You trade in your reality for a role . You give up your ability to feel , and in exchange , put on a mask .
INFP	Freedom is the right to tell people what they do not want to hear .
ESTP	True individual freedom can not exist without economic security and independence . People who are hungry and out of a job are the stuff of which dictatorships are made .
INFP	Punk is musical freedom . It 's saying , doing and playing what you want . In Webster 's terms , 'nirvana ' means freedom from pain , suffering and the external world , and that 's pretty close to my definition of Punk Rock .
ESFP	In the long history of the world , only a few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger . I do not shrink from this responsibility - I welcome it .
INFJ	Freedom is never dear at any price . It is the breath of life . What would a man not pay for living ?
ISTJ	Most people do not really want freedom , because freedom involves responsibility , and most people are frightened of responsibility .
ISFP	I am involved in a freedom ride protesting the loss of the minority rights belonging to the few remaining earthbound stars . All we demanded was our right to twinkle .
INFJ	Violent means will give violent freedom . That would be a menace to the world and to India herself .
ESFP	The path we have chosen for the present is full of hazards , as all paths are . The cost of freedom is always high , but Americans have always paid it . And one path we shall never choose , and that is the path of surrender , or submission .
INFP	I am interested in anything about revolt , disorder , chaos-especially activity that seems to have no meaning . It seems to me to be the road toward freedom ... Rather than starting inside , I start outside and reach the mental through the physical .
INFJ	If we do n't believe in freedom of expression for people we despise , we do n't believe in it at all .
ISFP	A hero is someone who understands the responsibility that comes with his freedom .
INFP	I 'm interested in anything about revolt , disorder , chaos , especially activity that appears to have no meaning . It seems to me to be the road toward freedom .
ESFP	We can not expect that all nations will adopt like systems , for conformity is the jailer of freedom and the enemy of growth .
INTP	I believe there are more instances of the abridgement of freedom of the people by gradual and silent encroachments by those in power than by violent and sudden usurpations .
INFP	War is peace . Freedom is slavery . Ignorance is strength .
ESFP	Freedom means you are unobstructed in living your life as you choose . Anything less is a form of slavery .
ENFJ	Money wo n't create success , the freedom to make it will .
ENFP	Well , if crime fighters fight crime and fire fighters fight fire , what do freedom fighters fight ? They never mention that part to us , do they ?
ISFP	I think my first album opened a lot of doors for me to push the freedom of speech to the limit .
INTJ	Nothing has been purchased more dearly than the little bit of reason and sense of freedom which now constitutes our pride .
INFP	A free press can , of course , be good or bad , but , most certainly without freedom , the press will never be anything but bad .
ENFJ	Let freedom reign . The sun never set on so glorious a human achievement .
ESTJ	The framers of our Constitution meant we were to have freedom of religion , not freedom from religion .
ENFJ	Communists have always played an active role in the fight by colonial countries for their freedom , because the short-term objects of Communism would always correspond with the long-term objects of freedom movements .
ENFJ	Where globalization means , as it so often does , that the rich and powerful now have new means to further enrich and empower themselves at the cost of the poorer and weaker , we have a responsibility to protest in the name of universal freedom .
ISFP	I think of a hero as someone who understands the degree of responsibility that comes with his freedom .
ISFJ	Religious liberty is the first freedom in our Constitution . And whether the cause is justice for the persecuted , compassion for the needy and the sick , or mercy for the child waiting to be born , there is no greater force for good in the nation than Christian conscience in action .
ESTP	I believe in a religion that believes in freedom . Any time I have to accept a religion that wo n't let me fight a battle for my people , I say to hell with that religion .
INFP	Without culture , and the relative freedom it implies , society , even when perfect , is but a jungle . This is why any authentic creation is a gift to the future .
INFP	Men are never really willing to die except for the sake of freedom : therefore they do not believe in dying completely .
ENFJ	Only free men can negotiate prisoners can not enter into contracts . Your freedom and mine can not be separated .
ENFJ	There is no such thing as part freedom .
ENTP	We , the People , recognize that we have responsibilities as well as rights that our destinies are bound together that a freedom which only asks what 's in it for me , a freedom without a commitment to others , a freedom without love or charity or duty or patriotism , is unworthy of our founding ideals , and those who died in their defense .
ESTP	Freedom from effort in the present merely means that there has been effort stored up in the past .
ENFJ	Our single most important challenge is therefore to help establish a social order in which the freedom of the individual will truly mean the freedom of the individual .
ESTP	If you 're not ready to die for it , put the word 'freedom ' out of your vocabulary .
ISTP	There is only one kind of freedom and that 's individual liberty . Our lives come from our creator and our liberty comes from our creator . It has nothing to do with government granting it .
INFP	I was ecstatic they re-named 'French Fries ' as 'Freedom Fries ' . Grown men and women in positions of power in the U.S. government showing themselves as idiots .
INFJ	I wish that every human life might be pure transparent freedom .
ENTP	For more than four decades , the Libyan people have been ruled by a tyrant - Moammar Gaddafi . He has denied his people freedom , exploited their wealth , murdered opponents at home and abroad , and terrorized innocent people around the world - including Americans who were killed by Libyan agents .
ESTP	You ca n't separate peace from freedom because no one can be at peace unless he has his freedom .
INTJ	Necessity is blind until it becomes conscious . Freedom is the consciousness of necessity .
ISFJ	We believe in individual initiative , personal responsibility , opportunity , freedom , small government , the Constitution . These principles , these American principles are key to getting our economy back to being successful and leading the world .
ENTP	Freedom is n't free . It should n't be a bragging point that 'Oh , I do n't get involved in politics , ' as if that makes someone cleaner . No , that makes you derelict of duty in a republic . Liars and panderers in government would have a much harder time of it if so many people did n't insist on their right to remain ignorant and blindly agreeable .
ISFJ	Our plans protect freedom and opportunity , and our blueprint is the Constitution of the United States .
ISFJ	If I am elected President of these United States , I will work with all my energy and soul to restore that America , to lift our eyes to a better future . That future is our destiny . That future is out there . It is waiting for us . Our children deserve it , our nation depends upon it , the peace and freedom of the world require it .
INFP	There are necessary evils . Money is an important thing in terms of representing freedom in our world . And now I have a daughter to think about . It 's really the first time I 've thought about the future and what it could be .
ISFJ	Perhaps religious conscience upsets the designs of those who feel that the highest wisdom and authority comes from government . But from the beginning , this nation trusted in God , not man . Religious liberty is the first freedom in our Constitution .
ISFJ	Religious freedom opens a door for Americans that is closed to too many others around the world . But whether we walk through that door , and what we do with our lives after we do , is up to us .
ISTJ	History does not long entrust the care of freedom to the weak or the timid .
ISTP	You do n't have freedom because you are a hyphenated American you have freedom because you are an individual , and that should be protected .
ENFP	A man may be a pessimistic determinist before lunch and an optimistic believer in the will 's freedom after it .
ISFJ	And let me make this very clear - unlike President Obama , I will not raise taxes on the middle class . As president , I will protect the sanctity of life . I will honor the institution of marriage . And I will guarantee America 's first liberty : the freedom of religion .
ISFJ	We still believe in the America that is a land of opportunity and a beacon of freedom . We believe in the America that challenges each of us to be better and bigger than ourselves .
ISFJ	Since Castro took power , the Cuban people have been denied basic human freedoms . No freedom of religion , no freedom of the press , no political freedom . And the regime uses brutality and violence to suppress these freedoms and impose its will .
ENFP	Your true traveller finds boredom rather agreeable than painful . It is the symbol of his liberty - his excessive freedom . He accepts his boredom , when it comes , not merely philosophically , but almost with pleasure .
INTP	Every friend of freedom must be as revolted as I am by the prospect of turning the United States into an armed camp , by the vision of jails filled with casual drug users and of an army of enforcers empowered to invade the liberty of citizens on slight evidence .
ISTP	Back a hundred years ago , especially around Woodrow Wilson , what happened in this country is we took freedom and we chopped it into pieces .
ISFJ	The words spoken by the leader of the free world can expand the frontiers of freedom or shrink them . When Ronald Reagan called on Gorbachev to 'tear down this wall , ' a surge of confidence rose that would ultimately breach the bounds of the evil empire .
ISFJ	Make no mistake , in this campaign , I will offer the American ideals of economic freedom a clear and unapologetic defense .
ISFJ	President Obama orders religious organizations to violate their conscience . I will defend religious liberty and overturn regulations that trample on our first freedom .
ISFJ	I do n't want to transform America . I want to restore to America the economic values of freedom and opportunity and limited government that has made us the powerhouse of the world .
ENFP	The worst enemy of life , freedom and the common decencies is total anarchy their second worst enemy is total efficiency .
ENFJ	There can be no real freedom without the freedom to fail .
INTP	The only way that has ever been discovered to have a lot of people cooperate together voluntarily is through the free market . And that 's why it 's so essential to preserving individual freedom .
INTP	No nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare .
INTJ	When people talk of the freedom of writing , speaking or thinking I can not choose but laugh . No such thing ever existed . No such thing now exists but I hope it will exist . But it must be hundreds of years after you and I shall write and speak no more .
INFP	Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four . If that is granted , all else follows .
ESTP	You do n't have to be a man to fight for freedom . All you have to do is to be an intelligent human being .
INFP	I know but one freedom , and that is the freedom of the mind .
ISTJ	Analysis does not set out to make pathological reactions impossible , but to give the patient 's ego freedom to decide one way or another .
INTP	A major source of objection to a free economy is precisely that group thinks they ought to want . Underlying most arguments against the free market is a lack of belief in freedom itself .
ENTP	Freedom in general may be defined as the absence of obstacles to the realization of desires .
ENTP	Freedom of opinion can only exist when the government thinks itself secure .
ESTJ	Both the American people and nations that censor the internet should understand that our government is committed to helping promote internet freedom .
ESTJ	Freedom means the right of people to assemble , organize , and debate openly .
ENTP	Freedom comes only to those who no longer ask of life that it shall yield them any of those personal goods that are subject to the mutations of time .
INFP	Just living is not enough . One must have sunshine , freedom , and a little flower .
INTP	Underlying most arguments against the free market is a lack of belief in freedom itself .
ESTP	Freedom itself was attacked this morning by a faceless coward , and freedom will be defended .
INTP	The end of law is not to abolish or restrain , but to preserve and enlarge freedom . For in all the states of created beings capable of law , where there is no law , there is no freedom .
INTP	History suggests that capitalism is a necessary condition for political freedom . Clearly it is not a sufficient condition .
ISTP	A filmmaker has almost the same freedom as a novelist has when he buys himself some paper .
INFJ	In this possibly terminal phase of human existence , democracy and freedom are more than just ideals to be valued - they may be essential to survival .
ISTJ	We seek peace , knowing that peace is the climate of freedom .
ESTJ	I begin to feel like most Americans do n't understand the First Amendment , do n't understand the idea of freedom of speech , and do n't understand that it 's the responsibility of the citizen to speak out .
ENTJ	Human beings the world over need freedom and security that they may be able to realize their full potential .
ENFP	Who is more to be pitied , a writer bound and gagged by policemen or one living in perfect freedom who has nothing more to say ?
ISTJ	A just laicism allows religious freedom . The state does not impose religion but rather gives space to religions with a responsibility toward civil society , and therefore it allows these religions to be factors in building up society .
ESTP	Power in defense of freedom is greater than power in behalf of tyranny and oppression .
INTJ	Freedom is a right ultimately defended by the sacrifice of America 's servicemen and women .
ENTP	I am a lover of truth , a worshipper of freedom , a celebrant at the altar of language and purity and tolerance .
ESTP	The wisest use of American strength is to advance freedom .
ESFJ	The United Nations is designed to make possible lasting freedom and independence for all its members .
ENFP	Even before I knew I was gay , I knew I did n't want to have a child . I knew I did n't want to have one . I never want to have to release it from me . Listen , I love babies . I love children . And I melt when I 'm around them . I also love my freedom and I love that I can sleep at night .
INFJ	If one more 'journalist ' makes a cavalier statement about me and my band , I will personally or with my fans ' help , greet them at their home and discover just how much they believe in their freedom of speech .
ENTJ	We will not be intimidated or pushed off the world stage by people who do not like what we stand for , and that is , freedom , democracy and the fight against disease , poverty and terrorism .
ESTP	I believe that God has planted in every heart the desire to live in freedom .
ENFJ	Anywhere , anytime ordinary people are given the chance to choose , the choice is the same : freedom , not tyranny democracy , not dictatorship the rule of law , not the rule of the secret police .
ESTP	You ca n't put democracy and freedom back into a box .
INFP	To enjoy freedom we have to control ourselves .
ESFP	Novelists have always had complete freedom to pretty much tell their story any way they saw fit . And that 's what I 'm trying to do .
ISFP	I am conservative with a small 'c . ' It 's possible to be conservative in fiscal policy , and tolerant on moral issues or questions of freedom of expression .
ESFJ	In South Africa , we could not have achieved our freedom and just peace without the help of people around the world , who through the use of non-violent means , such as boycotts and divestment , encouraged their governments and other corporate actors to reverse decades-long support for the Apartheid regime .
ENTP	Pleasure and freedom from pain , are the only things desirable as ends .
ENFJ	Look , freedom is an overwhelming American notion . The idea that we want to see the world , the peoples of the world free is something that all of us subscribe to .
ESTP	For all who love freedom and peace , the world without Saddam Hussein 's regime is a better and safer place .
ESFJ	The price of freedom is eternal vigilance .
ESTP	Freedom is not enough .
ESTP	The United States of America will never be intimidated by thugs and assassins . The killers will fail , and the Iraqi people will live in freedom .
ESTP	The fifth freedom is freedom from ignorance .
ESFJ	Exclusion is never the way forward on our shared paths to freedom and justice .
ISFJ	We ca n't equate democracy with Christianity because the largest democracy on earth is India , which is primarily Hindu . The third largest democracy is Indonesia , which is Islamic . Democracy and freedom are not dependent on Christian beliefs .
INFP	None can love freedom heartily , but good men the rest love not freedom , but licence .
INTP	Economic growth may one day turn out to be a curse rather than a good , and under no conditions can it either lead into freedom or constitute a proof for its existence .
ESFJ	Watching President Obama apologize last week for America 's arrogance - before a French audience that owes its freedom to the sacrifices of Americans - helped convince me that he has a deep-seated antipathy toward American values and traditions .
ENTP	If the events of September 11 , 2001 , have proven anything , it 's that the terrorists can attack us , but they ca n't take away what makes us American - our freedom , our liberty , our civil rights . No , only Attorney General John Ashcroft can do that .
ENTP	Our culture is just a series of checks and balances . The whole idea that we 're in a battle between tyranny and freedom - it 's a series of pendulum swings .
ISFJ	The best way to enhance freedom in other lands is to demonstrate here that our democratic system is worthy of emulation .
ENTP	A mere forty years ago , beach volleyball was just beginning . No bureaucrat would have invented it , and that 's what freedom is all about .
INTP	No cause is left but the most ancient of all , the one , in fact , that from the beginning of our history has determined the very existence of politics , the cause of freedom versus tyranny .
INFJ	In many respects , the United States is a great country . Freedom of speech is protected more than in any other country . It is also a very free society .
ESFP	Not to sound overly cheesy but I really appreciate the freedom we have in America - especially as a female .
ENFJ	Every therapeutic cure , and still more , any awkward attempt to show the patient the truth , tears him from the cradle of his freedom from responsibility and must therefore reckon with the most vehement resistance .
ENTJ	The magic of America is that we 're a free and open society with a mixed population . Part of our security is our freedom .
ESFJ	And we can celebrate when we have a government that has earned back the trust of the people it serves ... when we have a government that honors our Constitution and stands up for the values that have made America , America : economic freedom , individual liberty , and personal responsibility .
INTP	Man can not be free if he does not know that he is subject to necessity , because his freedom is always won in his never wholly successful attempts to liberate himself from necessity .
INFJ	In the literal sense , there has been no relevant evolution since the trek from Africa . But there has been substantial progress towards higher standards of rights , justice and freedom - along with all too many illustrations of how remote is the goal of a decent society .
ISFP	Freedom is such a gift .
ENTJ	The American dream is about freedom .
ENTJ	Freedom is secured every day by our men and women in uniform . We must build a future worthy of their sacrifice .
ESFP	I love the freedom of movement that my phone gives me . That has definitely transformed my life .
ESTJ	To be honest , I 've always had far too much freedom . I had a job when I was 10 . I started living on my own when I was 17 or 18 . I 've earned my own money I 've traveled the world . What would I rebel against ?
ESTJ	I 'm a multidimensional person and that 's the freedom of fashion : that you 're able to reinvent yourself through how you dress and how you cut your hair or whatever .
ENFJ	When a truth is not given complete freedom , freedom is not complete .
ENTJ	Human beings want to be free and however long they may agree to stay locked up , to stay oppressed , there will come a time when they say 'That 's it . ' Suddenly they find themselves doing something that they never would have thought they would be doing , simply because of the human instinct that makes them turn their face towards freedom .
INFJ	Women are degraded by the propensity to enjoy the present moment , and , at last , despise the freedom which they have not sufficient virtue to struggle to attain .
ESFJ	The United States and Israel have a unique relationship based on our mutual commitment to democracy , freedom , and peace . Therefore , just as our commitment to these principles must be steadfast , so must our support for Israel .
ISFP	Too much freedom can lead to the soul 's decay .
ESTJ	Great research universities must insist on independence from government and on the exercise of academic freedom .
ENTP	To criticize a person for their race is manifestly irrational and ridiculous , but to criticize their religion , that is a right . That is a freedom .
ENFJ	The spread of freedom is the best security for the free .
ENTJ	Jobs mean freedom for workers to support their families .
ENFP	Rock and roll music - the music of freedom frightens people and unleashes all manner of conservative defense mechanisms .
ENTP	You can be a thousand different women . It 's your choice which one you want to be . It 's about freedom and sovereignty . You celebrate who you are . You say , 'This is my kingdom . '
INTP	An almost hysterical antagonism toward the gold standard is one issue which unites statists of all persuasions . They seem to sense ... that gold and economic freedom are inseparable .
ESTJ	We do n't have an Official Secrets Act in the United States , as other countries do . Under the First Amendment , freedom of the press , freedom of speech , and freedom of association are more important than protecting secrets .
ENTP	We must plan for freedom , and not only for security , if for no other reason than that only freedom can make security secure .
ENTJ	If you can make people understand why freedom is so important through the arts , that would be a big help .
INTP	My view is that good community management is like having good municipal government : You should be able to have dissenting opinions and so on , freedom of speech , but your grandmother should also be able to walk down the street at night without having to worry about getting mugged .
ESTJ	I do n't believe in firing professors . They have academic freedom .
INFP	It would be too frightening for me to consider myself a role model . But I like the idea of not being afraid of letting your imagination rule you , to feel the freedom of expression , to let creativity be your overwhelming drive rather than other things .
ESFJ	I was n't a woman who stayed tiny like I thought I would . I definitely gave myself the freedom to eat what I wanted .
ESFJ	I 'm privileged , because I have a lot of freedom . I want to use it to make as warm and normal a life as I can for our daughters .
ESFJ	They know the importance of their mission and of America 's commitment to combating and defeating terrorism abroad , and they know that they are making a real difference in bringing freedom to a part of the world that has known only tyranny .
ESFJ	They have called Operation Iraqi Freedom a war of choice that is n't part of the real war on terror . Someone should tell that to al Qaeda .
ESFJ	The job of training an Iraqi police force is one of the most important tasks being undertaken in Operation Iraqi Freedom . It is also one of the most difficult .
ISFP	I needed freedom to really express myself . That 's really what Justified is about .
ISTP	Not caring more about what other people think than what you think . That 's freedom .
ESTJ	The people of the Middle East share the desire for freedom . We have an opportunity - and an obligation - to help them turn this desire into reality .
ESTJ	The U.S. has since the end of World War II had an answer - we stand for free peoples and free markets , we are willing to support and defend them - we will sustain a balance of power that favors freedom .
ENFP	I mean there 's enormous pressures to harmonize freedom of speech legislation and transparency legislation around the world - within the E.U. , between China and the United States . Which way is it going to go ? It 's hard to see .
ENTP	Another hero was Tom Swift , in the books . What he stood for , the freedom , the scientific knowledge and being and engineer gave him the ability to invent solutions to problems . He 's always been a hero to me . I buy old Tom Swift books now and read them to my own children .
INFP	Do n't walk behind me I may not lead . Do n't walk in front of me I may not follow . Just walk beside me and be my friend .
ENFJ	Lots of people want to ride with you in the limo , but what you want is someone who will take the bus with you when the limo breaks down .
ISTJ	Be courteous to all , but intimate with few , and let those few be well tried before you give them your confidence .
ENFP	True friends stab you in the front .
ENTJ	A friend to all is a friend to none .
ENTJ	Friendship is a single soul dwelling in two bodies .
INFJ	But friendship is precious , not only in the shade , but in the sunshine of life , and thanks to a benevolent arrangement the greater part of life is sunshine .
INTP	Am I not destroying my enemies when I make friends of them ?
ISFP	The friend in my adversity I shall always cherish most . I can better trust those who helped to relieve the gloom of my dark hours than those who are so ready to enjoy with me the sunshine of my prosperity .
ENFP	Each friend represents a world in us , a world not born until they arrive , and it is only by this meeting that a new world is born .
ENFP	An excellent man he has no enemies and none of his friends like him .
ENTJ	Wishing to be friends is quick work , but friendship is a slow ripening fruit .
ENFP	He has no enemies , but is intensely disliked by his friends .
INTJ	Love is blind friendship closes its eyes .
ENTJ	What is a friend ? A single soul dwelling in two bodies .

ENFP	No matter how popular you are as a stand-up - you can go out and fill a 10,000-seat arena and be smart and funny - it 's delicate to host an awards show and know where your place is and know that it 's not about you , that it 's about the people who are nominated , and respect that , but at the same time have your moment to show them who you are .

ISTP	I had to act in a school play when I was about ten years old . I really did n't want to do it . But everyone had to do it so I did n't have a choice .

ISTP	I 'm like , bursting . I should be working . I do n't want to take a break . It 's funny , on set , I do n't have to go to the bathroom , I do n't have anything wrong , I 'm perfectly fine , so through-and-through . I 'm not hungry . I 'm literally not even in my own body .

ISFJ	There 's something dangerous about what 's funny . Jarring and disconcerting . There is a connection between funny and scary .

ISTP	I find it very easy playing Bond . I think he 's hilarious . He gets himself into some extraordinarily funny situations .
ISFJ	Laurence Olivier said in an interview once that when he plays a tragedy he always aims for the funny parts , and the other way around . Because in a comedy you look for what 's serious . I think that 's true . Sometimes things are really funny if you 're absolutely earnest . If you 're really serious , it 's hilarious .
ISFJ	I never know when I am being funny , and the other way too . I do n't think you can think about that . I do n't think you can try to be funny . Some people are just funny .
INFP	I 'm just not one of those naturally funny , relaxed actors who enjoy the spotlight and are so good at it .
INFP	It was always a fantasy of mine growing up - my favorite program was always 'Little House on the Prairie ' - so I always wanted to wear those looks .

ESTJ	It 's funny that there was so much disturbance about having a Catholic in the White House with Kennedy , and when we finally get a religion in the White House that 's causing a lot of conflicts , and concerns , and disturbances for a lot of people , it 's in the Bush Administration .

INFP	It 's funny how the hippies and the punks tried to get rid of the conservatives , but they always seem to get the upper hand in the end .
INFP	I recently spent quite a bit of time in Sheffield , England , which is where I 'm from .

ESTJ	When I was a kid I did n't feel like I fit in because - this is really silly and I probably should n't say it , but , I did n't think anything was funny . So I used to go home and literally cry to my mom and my step-dad at the time and I did n't think anything was funny . I could n't laugh .
INFP	Music is more difficult - try naming a political band . The Dead Kennedys . The Dead Kennedys are political , but they are more funny than they are political .

ENFJ	Also , in a funny way , if you have been happily married there are no unresolved areas , nothing to prove to yourself after the other dies .

ESTP	I 've dated some women who have turned me on to some funny things that are strange for men to actually do , but these things have become part of my process . I think the things I do for my appearance help make me look better . I even colour my hair because I like how it makes me look .
INFJ	I do find comedy difficult . I do n't know why . Maybe I think about it too much . There 's a tremendous amount of pressure to be funny .

It 's not like we even had a plan when I dragged my mom to Los Angeles .
ESTP	The empires of the future are the empires of the mind .
ENFP	Every saint has a past and every sinner has a future .
ISTP	Again , you ca n't connect the dots looking forward you can only connect them looking backwards . So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future .

INFP	It is not in the stars to hold our destiny but in ourselves .

INTJ	All sciences are now under the obligation to prepare the ground for the future task of the philosopher , which is to solve the problem of value , to determine the true hierarchy of values .

And so I think that we 'd like to continue to keep our powder dry , because we do feel that there are one or more strategic opportunities in the future .
INFP	Real generosity toward the future lies in giving all to the present .
ESFP	Go for it now . The future is promised to no one .

ISFJ	The American people I talk to do n't spend every moment thinking , 'How can I tax my neighbor more than they 're being taxed ? ' They say , 'How can I get a good job ? How can my kids get good jobs ? How can seniors have a confidence in their future when they know that Social Security , Medicare and Medicaid are bankrupt ? '
ISFJ	Internationally , President Obama has adopted an appeasement strategy . He believes America 's role as leader in the world is a thing of the past . I believe a strong America must - and will - lead the future .
ESTJ	The worst thing that can happen in a democracy - as well as in an individual 's life - is to become cynical about the future and lose hope .

We share common values and a commitment to a democratic future for the world , and we are both committed to a two-state solution . But that does n't mean that we 're going to agree .
ISFJ	Republicans are men of narrow vision , who are afraid of the future .
ESFP	People always ask me , 'What is it that you regret ? ' And I say , 'nothing , because I could not buy what I 've learned . ' And I apply those things to my life I learn . And hopefully , hopefully it helps me to be a better human in the future and make better choices .

INTP	Evolution never looks to the future .
ENTP	When you get just a complete sense of blackness or void ahead of you , that somehow the future looks an impossible place to be , and the direction you are going seems to have no purpose , there is this word despair which is a very awful thing to feel .
ENTP	I like today and perhaps a little future still , but the past is really something I 'm not interested in . So , as far as I 'm concerned , I like only the past of things and people I do n't know . When I know , I do n't care because I knew how it was .
ENTJ	If we have to use force , it is because we are America . We are the indispensable nation . We stand tall . We see further into the future .
ENTP	We 're at the crossroads . Down one road is a European centralized bureaucratic socialist welfare system in which politicians and bureaucrats define the future . Down the other road is a proud , solid , reaffirmation of American exceptionalism .
INFP	I 'm not good at future planning . I do n't plan at all . I do n't know what I 'm doing tomorrow . I do n't have a day planner and I do n't have a diary . I completely live in the now , not in the past , not in the future .
INFP	The problem with the future is that it keeps turning into the present .
ESFP	I believe life is a series of near misses . A lot of what we ascribe to luck is not luck at all . It 's seizing the day and accepting responsibility for your future . It 's seeing what other people do n't see And pursuing that vision .
ESFJ	Do your duty and a little more and the future will take care of itself .
ISFP	I 'm a person that carries everything that happened to me in my past , with me into the future . I refuse to let it make me bitter . I still completely believe in love and I remain open to anything that will happen to me .

ISTP	I 'm always thinking about creating . My future starts when I wake up every morning ... Every day I find something creative to do with my life .

ISFP	I 'm working on bringing the instant film camera back as part of the future .
ENFP	I 'm not sitting dwelling about the past or stressing or fretting about something in the future .
ISFJ	All I can say is that I 'm getting married in the future . I 've narrowed it down to that .
ISFJ	I am confident that when the facts and policies have been examined , when the record of performances have been reviewed , Barack Obama and Joe Biden will once again be elected to lead our beloved country to a better future .
ESFP	We 're trying to set up a movie for me in the near future . It 's going to be similar to the story of how I got discovered . Kinda like my own version of '8 Mile . '
ESFP	I 'm happy , I 'm in a good place , I 'm looking forward to my future .
INTJ	The question of armaments , whether on land or sea , is the most immediately and intensely practical question connected with the future fortunes of nations and of mankind .
INTJ	The importance of money flows from it being a link between the present and the future .
ENTP	My theme is going to be : Together we can win the future . The right policies lead to the right results . And I 'm going to argue that President Obama will lose the future because the wrong policies lead to the wrong results .
ISFP	My future daughter is not going to go through what I did .
ISFP	When you relinquish the desire to control your future , you can have more happiness .
ENTP	I think my view is that whenever you project into the future you 're never likely to be accurate in the details , or the paraphernalia and style . It 's in the spirit of it .
ENTP	You have to like the present if not your life becomes secondhand , if you think it was better before . Or that it will be better in the future .
ENFJ	Our modern states are preparing for war without even knowing the future enemy .
ENTJ	If GE 's strategy of investment in China is wrong , it represents a loss of a billion dollars , perhaps a couple of billion dollars . If it is right , it is the future of this company for the next century .
ENFP	Up against the corporate government , voters find themselves asked to choose between look-alike candidates from two parties vying to see who takes the marching orders from their campaign paymasters and their future employers . The money of vested interest nullifies genuine voter choice and trust .
INTP	Promises are the uniquely human way of ordering the future , making it predictable and reliable to the extent that this is humanly possible .
INTJ	There is a huge need and a huge opportunity to get everyone in the world connected , to give everyone a voice and to help transform society for the future . The scale of the technology and infrastructure that must be built is unprecedented , and we believe this is the most important problem we can focus on .
INTJ	The social object of skilled investment should be to defeat the dark forces of time and ignorance which envelope our future .
ENFJ	The White House is n't the place to learn how to deal with international crisis , the balance of power , war and peace , and the economic future of the next generation .
ESFJ	I 'm pro-life . I 'll do all I can to see every baby is created with a future and potential . The legislature should do all it can to protect human life .
ENFJ	In retrospect , the Millennium marked only a moment in time . It was the events of September 11 that marked a turning point in history , where we confront the dangers of the future and assess the choices facing humankind .
ISTP	The future battle on the ground will be preceded by battle in the air . This will determine which of the contestants has to suffer operational and tactical disadvantages and be forced throughout the battle into adoption compromise solutions .

ENFJ	I never have plans for the future as you never know how things will turn out .
INFP	I do n't have that much forward planning about what I want to do next , or in the future .
ESFJ	No one is going to try to fill my mother 's shoes , what she did was fantastic . It 's about making your own future and your own destiny and Kate will do a very good job of that .
ENTJ	What we 're discussing privately and publicly , is a budget which is a blueprint for the future which creates jobs , which educates our children , which provides healthcare for all Americans , which takes our deficit down , which gives a tax cut for 95 % of the American people .
INFP	The people in charge , globally , are maniacs . They are maniacs , and unless we do something about it these people are going to deprive us of a future .
ENTJ	The claim made by Team Obama that every dollar in stimulus translates into a dollar-and-a-half in growth is economic fiction . The costs of stimulus reduce future growth . No country has ever spent itself to prosperity . The price of stimulus has to be paid sometime .
ESTJ	I 'm a big laser believer - I really think they are the wave of the future .
ISFP	I 've been doing musical theater since I was a kid . And look for a CD from me in the future . I want to write all the songs !
ISTJ	The euro is our common fate , and Europe is our common future .
ENTJ	We inadvertently bombed the Chinese Embassy . But Clinton now is working very hard . He has sent a letter of apology to the Chinese . And , he 's also given them a gift certificate for future nuclear secrets .
ESTP	As much as we all talk about the future and how so many things are merging , there is a simplicity that is crucial .
ISTP	I really hope that we 'll have a sustainable future on this planet , I really do . So I probably geek out mostly about learning more about how potentially we can hopefully make that happen , hopefully we 're not too far lost .
ENFP	I 'm already the most fortunate girl in the world , so I have zero expectations for what the future will bring .
ISTP	Whether they run a record company or a grocery store , every boss will tell you you 're in big trouble if you 're borrowing more than you can ever afford to pay back . Delaying the pain for future generations is suicidal . We 've got to start getting the deficit down right now , not next year .
INFP	I suppose I 'm intrigued with the bad traits of society , because I 'm a part of society , and the bad traits pose the dangerous questions for our future .
INFP	We kinda look at this as the second or third chapter of our lives . After college , most people figure out what they want to do with their lives . But we already know what we want to do in the future and that is to continue to further our business goals .
ESFJ	You never know what the future brings .
ENTP	We must cultivate our own garden . When man was put in the garden of Eden he was put there so that he should work , which proves that man was not born to rest .
ENFP	I do n't like formal gardens . I like wild nature . It 's just the wilderness instinct in me , I guess .
ISTJ	To dwell is to garden .
ESFJ	I loathe gardening , but I love gardens , and I have two beautiful gardens . I can not bear gardening , but I love gardens .
INTP	Sir , my concern is not whether God is on our side my greatest concern is to be on God 's side , for God is always right .
ISFJ	We need to find God , and he can not be found in noise and restlessness . God is the friend of silence . See how nature - trees , flowers , grass- grows in silence see the stars , the moon and the sun , how they move in silence ... We need silence to be able to touch souls .
INTP	When the solution is simple , God is answering .
INFJ	God , as Truth , has been for me a treasure beyond price . May He be so to every one of us .
ESTJ	The Christian life is not a constant high . I have my moments of deep discouragement . I have to go to God in prayer with tears in my eyes , and say , 'O God , forgive me , ' or 'Help me . '
INFJ	Each one prays to God according to his own light .
INFJ	God is , even though the whole world deny him . Truth stands , even if there be no public support . It is self-sustained .
ESTJ	God has given us two hands , one to receive with and the other to give with .
INTP	The Bible is one of the greatest blessings bestowed by God on the children of men . It has God for its author salvation for its end , and truth without any mixture for its matter . It is all pure .
ENFJ	God who is eternally complete , who directs the stars , who is the master of fates , who elevates man from his lowliness to Himself , who speaks from the cosmos to every single human soul , is the most brilliant manifestation of the goal of perfection .
ENFP	There 's only one effectively redemptive sacrifice , the sacrifice of self-will to make room for the knowledge of God .
ESFP	Throughout life people will make you mad , disrespect you and treat you bad . Let God deal with the things they do , cause hate in your heart will consume you too .
ENFP	Only one thing is impossible for God : To find any sense in any copyright law on the planet .
ESFP	If we ever forget that we are One Nation Under God , then we will be a nation gone under .
ISTJ	It is impossible to rightly govern a nation without God and the Bible .
INFP	I would rather live my life as if there is a God and die to find out there is n't , than live my life as if there is n't and die to find out there is .
INFP	I believe in God , but not as one thing , not as an old man in the sky . I believe that what people call God is something in all of us . I believe that what Jesus and Mohammed and Buddha and all the rest said was right . It 's just that the translations have gone wrong .
ENFJ	I just want to do God 's will . And he 's allowed me to go to the mountain . And I 've looked over , and I 've seen the promised land ! I may not get there with you , but I want you to know tonight that we as a people will get to the promised land .
INFP	God has given you one face , and you make yourself another .
INFJ	I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just that his justice can not sleep forever .
INTP	I can not imagine a God who rewards and punishes the objects of his creation and is but a reflection of human frailty .
INTP	With Malice toward none , with charity for all , with firmness in the right , as God gives us to see the right , let us strive on to finish the work we are in , to bind up the nation 's wounds .
ISFJ	Let us more and more insist on raising funds of love , of kindness , of understanding , of peace . Money will come if we seek first the Kingdom of God - the rest will be given .
INTP	God does not play dice .
INTP	I do not believe in the God of theology who rewards good and punishes evil .
INTP	I shall never believe that God plays dice with the world .
INTP	We should take care not to make the intellect our god it has , of course , powerful muscles , but no personality .

INTP	God may be subtle , but he is n't plain mean .
INFP	Ignorance is the curse of God knowledge is the wing wherewith we fly to heaven .
ESFP	Geography has made us neighbors . History has made us friends . Economics has made us partners , and necessity has made us allies . Those whom God has so joined together , let no man put asunder .
ISFJ	There is always the danger that we may just do the work for the sake of the work . This is where the respect and the love and the devotion come in - that we do it to God , to Christ , and that 's why we try to do it as beautifully as possible .
INTP	Surely God would not have created such a being as man , with an ability to grasp the infinite , to exist only for a day ! No , no , man was made for immortality .
ISFJ	I try to give to the poor people for love what the rich could get for money . No , I would n't touch a leper for a thousand pounds yet I willingly cure him for the love of God .
INTP	In great contests each party claims to act in accordance with the will of God . Both may be , and one must be wrong .
INFJ	I have sworn upon the altar of God , eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man .

ENFP	Man - a creature made at the end of the week 's work when God was tired .

ENFP	I sometimes think that God in creating man somewhat overestimated his ability .
ENFP	God is a metaphor for that which transcends all levels of intellectual thought . It 's as simple as that .
ESTP	It is foolish and wrong to mourn the men who died . Rather we should thank God that such men lived .

INTJ	I have held many things in my hands , and I have lost them all but whatever I have placed in God 's hands , that I still possess .
INFJ	My religion is based on truth and non-violence . Truth is my God . Non-violence is the means of realising Him .

INFJ	Where love is , there God is also .
INFJ	God sometimes does try to the uttermost those whom he wishes to bless .
ENFP	I think that God , in creating man , somewhat overestimated his ability .
INFJ	It is the quality of our work which will please God and not the quantity .
INFP	You 're just left with yourself all the time , whatever you do anyway . You 've got to get down to your own God in your own temple . It 's all down to you , mate .
INFP	O God , O God , how weary , stale , flat , and unprofitable seem to me all the uses of this world !
ESTJ	God will prepare everything for our perfect happiness in heaven , and if it takes my dog being there , I believe he 'll be there .
ENTP	I have never made but one prayer to God , a very short one : 'O Lord make my enemies ridiculous . ' And God granted it .
INTJ	I can not and will not recant anything , for to go against conscience is neither right nor safe . Here I stand , I can do no other , so help me God . Amen .
ENTP	God helps those who help themselves .
ISTJ	Let us raise a standard to which the wise and honest can repair the rest is in the hands of God .

INFP	God is a concept by which we measure our pain .

ENTJ	He who is unable to live in society , or who has no need because he is sufficient for himself , must be either a beast or a god .
INTJ	I can not believe in a God who wants to be praised all the time .
INFP	He did n't come out of my belly , but my God , I 've made his bones , because I 've attended to every meal , and how he sleeps , and the fact that he swims like a fish because I took him to the ocean . I 'm so proud of all those things . But he is my biggest pride .

INTJ	God not only plays dice , He also sometimes throws the dice where they can not be seen .

ENTP	It is not known precisely where angels dwell whether in the air , the void , or the planets . It has not been God 's pleasure that we should be informed of their abode .

ISTP	If only God would give me some clear sign ! Like making a large deposit in my name at a Swiss bank .
ENFP	God is n't compatible with machinery and scientific medicine and universal happiness . You must make your choice . Our civilization has chosen machinery and medicine and happiness .

ENTJ	To do all that one is able to do , is to be a man to do all that one would like to do , is to be a god .

INTJ	Not only does God play dice , but ... he sometimes throws them where they can not be seen .
ESTJ	God 's mercy and grace give me hope - for myself , and for our world .
INTP	A universe with a God would look quite different from a universe without one . A physics , a biology where there is a God is bound to look different . So the most basic claims of religion are scientific . Religion is a scientific theory .
ESTJ	I ca n't prove it scientifically , that there 's a God , but I believe .
ISTP	As the poet said , 'Only God can make a tree , ' probably because it 's so hard to figure out how to get the bark on .
ESTJ	Communism has decided against God , against Christ , against the Bible , and against all religion .

INFJ	If there is no God , everything is permitted .
INTJ	To surrender to ignorance and call it God has always been premature , and it remains premature today .
ESTJ	You know , it 's ironic to me that Christians want to keep the Ten Commandments in our schools , because Christianity has abrogated four of the Ten Commandments . For example , the Sabbath day according to the Ten Commandments is Saturday , not Sunday . And the reason is because God rested , not because Jesus was resurrected .
INFP	That the Jews assumed a right exclusively to the benefits of God will be a lasting witness against them and the same will it be against Christians .

And that 's a pretty tall order .

ISFJ	I am God 's vessel . But my greatest pain in life is that I will never be able to see myself perform live .
INTJ	Well , I 'll put it this way : you can certainly say belief in God makes people behave worse . That can be proved beyond a doubt .

INFJ	A wise and frugal Government , which shall restrain men from injuring one another , which shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement , and shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned . This is the sum of good government , and this is necessary to close the circlue of our felicities .

ESFP	If you 're not willing to work hard , let someone else do it . I 'd rather be with someone who does a horrible job , but gives 110 % than with someone who does a good job and gives 60 % .

ISFP	I do n't know if high society is different in other cities , but in Hollywood , important people ca n't stand to be invited someplace that is n't full of other important people . They do n't mind a few unfamous people being present because they make good listeners .
INTJ	Many a man fails as an original thinker simply because his memory it too good .
INTJ	It is good to express a thing twice right at the outset and so to give it a right foot and also a left one . Truth can surely stand on one leg , but with two it will be able to walk and get around .

INFP	The evil that is in the world almost always comes of ignorance , and good intentions may do as much harm as malevolence if they lack understanding .

INTJ	You say it is the good cause that hallows even war ? I say unto you : it is the good war that hallows any cause .
ENTP	A return to first principles in a republic is sometimes caused by the simple virtues of one man . His good example has such an influence that the good men strive to imitate him , and the wicked are ashamed to lead a life so contrary to his example .
ISFJ	Look within . Within is the fountain of good , and it will ever bubble up , if thou wilt ever dig .
INTJ	What is good ? All that heightens the feeling of power , the will to power , power itself in man .
INFP	I had a really good childhood up until I was nine , then a classic case of divorce really affected me .

INFP	To assert in any case that a man must be absolutely cut off from society because he is absolutely evil amounts to saying that society is absolutely good , and no-one in his right mind will believe this today .
ISTP	I met Woz when I was 13 , at a friend 's garage . He was about 18 . He was , like , the first person I met who knew more electronics than I did at that point .

ENFJ	Nonviolence is a good policy when the conditions permit .
ISTP	1913 was n't a very good year . 1913 gave us the income tax , the 16th amendment and the IRS .

ENTP	Better is the enemy of good .
ESTP	I think we consider too much the good luck of the early bird and not enough the bad luck of the early worm .

ISTP	I think a gentleman is someone who holds the comfort of other people above their own . The instinct to do that is inside every good man , I believe . The rules about opening doors and buying dinner and all of that other 'gentleman ' stuff is a chess game , especially these days .
INTJ	Good character is not formed in a week or a month . It is created little by little , day by day . Protracted and patient effort is needed to develop good character .

ISFJ	Whatever the universal nature assigns to any man at any time is for the good of that man at that time .
INTJ	And above all things , never think that you 're not good enough yourself . A man should never think that . My belief is that in life people will take you at your own reckoning .
ESTJ	Many of you are well enough off that the tax cuts may have helped you . We 're saying that for America to get back on track , we 're probably going to cut that short and not give it to you . We 're going to take things away from you on behalf of the common good .
INTJ	The man who has the will to undergo all labor may win to any good .

INTP	The sad truth is that most evil is done by people who never make up their minds to be good or evil .
ENTP	Heaven and hell suppose two distinct species of men , the good and the bad . But the greatest part of mankind float betwixt vice and virtue .

ISTP	I had three points I wanted to make : That not everybody in Hollywood is on the left , that Obama has broken a lot of the promises he made when he took office , and that the people should feel free to get rid of any politician who 's not doing a good job . But I did n't make up my mind exactly what I was going to say until I said it .
ENTP	The main foundations of every state , new states as well as ancient or composite ones , are good laws and good arms you can not have good laws without good arms , and where there are good arms , good laws inevitably follow .
ESTJ	We do n't have enough support for maternal leave and the kinds of things that some of the European countries do . So we still make it hard on women to go into the work force and feel that they can be good at work but then doing the most important job , which is raising your children in a responsible and positive way .
ENFP	Hell is n't merely paved with good intentions it 's walled and roofed with them . Yes , and furnished too .
INTP	Dedicate yourself to the good you deserve and desire for yourself . Give yourself peace of mind . You deserve to be happy . You deserve delight .
ISFJ	Julia progresses from cradle to grave , showing how government makes every good thing in her life possible . The weak economy , high unemployment , falling wages , rising gas prices , the national debt , the insolvency of entitlements - all these are fictionally assumed away in a cartoon that is produced by a president who wants us to forget about them .
ISTJ	I was n't in school often enough to really belong to a 'clique , ' but my friends all studied hard and got pretty good grades . They were good people with self-respect . I still like to be friends with people I admire something about I really believe that we become like the people we 're surrounded by , so I choose my friends carefully !
ISFJ	What does it say about a president 's policies when he has to use a cartoon character rather than real people to justify his record ? What does it say about the fiction of old liberalism to insist that good jobs and good schools and good wages will result from policies that have failed us , time and again ?
ISFJ	And that 's how it is in America . We look to our communities , our faiths , our families for our joy , our support , in good times and bad . It is both how we live our lives and why we live our lives .
ESTP	There is nothing I love as much as a good fight .
ISTJ	I have one yardstick by which I test every major problem - and that yardstick is : Is it good for America ?
INTP	To kill an error is as good a service as , and sometimes even better than , the establishing of a new truth or fact .
ENFP	A bad book is as much of a labor to write as a good one , it comes as sincerely from the author 's soul .
ISTJ	Why not invest your assets in the companies you really like ? As Mae West said , 'Too much of a good thing can be wonderful ' .
INFJ	One can know a man from his laugh , and if you like a man 's laugh before you know anything of him , you may confidently say that he is a good man .
ISTJ	Our forces saved the remnants of the Jewish people of Europe for a new life and a new hope in the reborn land of Israel . Along with all men of good will , I salute the young state and wish it well .
ENFP	Everyone who wants to do good to the human race always ends in universal bullying .
ESTP	It 's always good to be underestimated .
INTJ	It is no good getting furious if you get stuck . What I do is keep thinking about the problem but work on something else . Sometimes it is years before I see the way forward . In the case of information loss and black holes , it was 29 years .
ESTP	If it 's a good movie , the sound could go off and the audience would still have a perfectly clear idea of what was going on .
ESFJ	You know when something feels so good but you 're afraid to feel good about it ? So you kinda hold back ? Everyone says , Congratulations , you must be so happy . And you say something stupid like , I 'm just doing what little I can with what little I have .
ENFP	Like every other good thing in this world , leisure and culture have to be paid for . Fortunately , however , it is not the leisured and the cultured who have to pay .
ENFP	I keep my ideals , because in spite of everything I still believe that people are really good at heart .
ENTP	Those who forget good and evil and seek only to know the facts are more likely to achieve good than those who view the world through the distorting medium of their own desires .
ENFP	It 's with bad sentiments that one makes good novels .
ENFP	Like every man of sense and good feeling , I abominate work .
INTP	The reading of all good books is like a conversation with the finest minds of past centuries .
ESTP	My Alma mater was books , a good library ... I could spend the rest of my life reading , just satisfying my curiosity .
ENTP	The infliction of cruelty with a good conscience is a delight to moralists . That is why they invented Hell .
ESFJ	Richard Nixon is a no good , lying bastard . He can lie out of both sides of his mouth at the same time , and if he ever caught himself telling the truth , he 'd lie just to keep his hand in .
ESTJ	No good movie is too long and no bad movie is short enough .
INFP	Four legs good , two legs bad .
ISTP	I 'm such a good lover because I practice a lot on my own .
ISTP	I do n't believe that old cliche that good things come to those who wait . I think good things come to those who want something so bad they ca n't sit still .
INFP	Mankind is not likely to salvage civilization unless he can evolve a system of good and evil which is independent of heaven and hell .
ESFP	The good old days , when each idea had an owner , are gone forever .
ESFP	I 'm kind of a good girl - and I 'm not . I 'm a good girl because I really believe in love , integrity , and respect . I 'm a bad girl because I like to tease . I know that I have sex appeal in my deck of cards . But I like to get people thinking . That 's what the stories in my music do .
INFP	Good writing is like a windowpane .
INFP	Yet , taught by time , my heart has learned to glow for other 's good , and melt at other 's woe .
ENTJ	Real firmness is good for anything strut is good for nothing .
ISFP	To understand me , you have to meet me and be around me . And then only if I 'm in a good mood - do n't meet me in a bad mood .
ESTJ	I 've had extraordinary good luck with my health , other than a broken elbow .
ESTP	One of the key problems today is that politics is such a disgrace , good people do n't go into government .
INTJ	Greek philosophy seems to have met with something with which a good tragedy is not supposed to meet , namely , a dull ending .
INFP	Nothing that you do will ever feel good if you let people convince you that you have no choice .
INFP	War is war . The only good human being is a dead one .
INFP	Active Evil is better than Passive Good .
ENFJ	Hope is a state of mind , not of the world . Hope , in this deep and powerful sense , is not the same as joy that things are going well , or willingness to invest in enterprises that are obviously heading for success , but rather an ability to work for something because it is good .
ESFJ	I like a man who can be a real friend , has a good sense of humor , a good pair of shoes and a healthy gold card .
INFP	Ladies , if you want to know the way to my heart ... good spelling and good grammar , good punctuation , capitalize only where you are supposed to capitalize , it 's done .
ENFJ	But I can say that life is good to me . Has been and is good . So I think my task is to be good to it . So how do you be good to life ? You live it .
ISFP	The stories that I want to tell , especially as a director , do n't necessarily have a perfect ending because , the older you get , the more you appreciate a good day versus a happy ending . You understand that life continues on the next day the reality of things is what happens tomorrow .
ESTP	Well , real estate is always good , as far as I 'm concerned .
INFJ	Being generous or doing things for others actually makes me feel good so I do n't do it because I hope karma will come round and get me and I 'll benefit from it .
ENTP	Toleration is good for all , or it is good for none .
ISTJ	I have only one yardstick by which I test every major problem - and that yardstick is : Is it good for America ?
ISTP	All the good music has already been written by people with wigs and stuff .
ENTP	Man is a credulous animal , and must believe something in the absence of good grounds for belief , he will be satisfied with bad ones .
INFP	It is also true that one can write nothing readable unless one constantly struggles to efface one 's own personality . Good prose is like a windowpane .
INFP	Men are only as good as their technical development allows them to be .
INTJ	A good day is one where I can not just read a book , but write a review of it . Maybe today I 'll be able to do that . I get for some reason somewhat stronger when the sun starts to go down . Dusk is a good time for me . I 'm crepuscular .
ENTP	The most savage controversies are about matters as to which there is no good evidence either way .
ENFP	I 've gone for each type : the rough guy the nerdy , sweet , lovable guy and the slick guy . I do n't really have a type . Men in general are a good thing .
ESFP	But the real secret to lifelong good health is actually the opposite : Let your body take care of you .
INFP	There 's no regret . You ca n't regret . I mean , I 've felt regret but I 've also refused to allow regret to sow a seed and live in me because I do n't believe it . You feel it , it 's like guilt , it 's like jealousy , it 's like all those horrible things . You 've just got to snip them and get them out , because they 're no good .
INFJ	I hope we shall crush in its birth the aristocracy of our monied corporations which dare already to challenge our government to a trial by strength , and bid defiance to the laws of our country .
ISTJ	Government is not reason it is not eloquent it is force . Like fire , it is a dangerous servant and a fearful master .
ESTP	We make a living by what we get , but we make a life by what we give .
INFJ	Whenever the people are well-informed , they can be trusted with their own government .
ISTJ	The marvel of all history is the patience with which men and women submit to burdens unnecessarily laid upon them by their governments .
INTP	Knowledge will forever govern ignorance and a people who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives .
ENTP	Laws too gentle are seldom obeyed too severe , seldom executed .
INTJ	The government , which was designed for the people , has got into the hands of the bosses and their employers , the special interests . An invisible empire has been set up above the forms of democracy .
ESTP	It is to be regretted that the rich and powerful too often bend the acts of government to their own selfish purposes .
INTP	So that the record of history is absolutely crystal clear . That there is no alternative way , so far discovered , of improving the lot of the ordinary people that can hold a candle to the productive activities that are unleashed by a free enterprise system .
INTP	The government solution to a problem is usually as bad as the problem .
ENTP	What I worry about would be that you essentially have two chambers , the House and the Senate , but you have simply , majoritarian , absolute power on either side . And that 's just not what the founders intended .
INTP	If men were angels , no government would be necessary .
INTP	Governments never learn . Only people learn .
ESTP	The people are the government , administering it by their agents they are the government , the sovereign power .
ESFP	A corporation 's primary goal is to make money . Government 's primary role is to take a big chunk of that money and give it to others .
INFJ	If we can but prevent the government from wasting the labours of the people , under the pretence of taking care of them , they must become happy .
INFJ	My reading of history convinces me that most bad government results from too much government .
INTP	This country , with its institutions , belongs to the people who inhabit it . Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government , they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it , or exercise their revolutionary right to overthrow it .
INTP	Any people anywhere , being inclined and having the power , have the right to rise up , and shake off the existing government , and form a new one that suits them better . This is a most valuable - a most sacred right - a right , which we hope and believe , is to liberate the world .
ENFP	Patriotism is supporting your country all the time , and your government when it deserves it .
ESFP	Man is not free unless government is limited .
ESFP	Government exists to protect us from each other . Where government has gone beyond its limits is in deciding to protect us from ourselves .
ESFP	No government ever voluntarily reduces itself in size . Government programs , once launched , never disappear . Actually , a government bureau is the nearest thing to eternal life we 'll ever see on this earth !
ESFP	Government 's view of the economy could be summed up in a few short phrases : If it moves , tax it . If it keeps moving , regulate it . And if it stops moving , subsidize it .
ESFP	Government 's first duty is to protect the people , not run their lives .
INTP	Government of the people , by the people , for the people , shall not perish from the Earth .
INFJ	A Bill of Rights is what the people are entitled to against every government , and what no just government should refuse , or rest on inference .
INTP	Nothing is more destructive of respect for the government and the law of the land than passing laws which can not be enforced .
INTP	If you put the federal government in charge of the Sahara Desert , in 5 years there 'd be a shortage of sand .
ESFP	The problem is not that people are taxed too little , the problem is that government spends too much .
INTP	The philosophy of the school room in one generation will be the philosophy of government in the next .
INTJ	We are fast approaching the stage of the ultimate inversion : the stage where the government is free to do anything it pleases , while the citizens may act only by permission which is the stage of the darkest periods of human history , the stage of rule by brute force .
ESFP	The most terrifying words in the English language are : I 'm from the government and I 'm here to help .
ENFP	Loyalty to the country always . Loyalty to the government when it deserves it .
INTP	The people will save their government , if the government itself will allow them .
ESFP	Government does not solve problems it subsidizes them .
INTJ	Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people . It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other .
ESTP	Let us never forget that government is ourselves and not an alien power over us . The ultimate rulers of our democracy are not a President and senators and congressmen and government officials , but the voters of this country .
ESFP	Government is like a baby . An alimentary canal with a big appetite at one end and no sense of responsibility at the other .
ESTP	It has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except all the others that have been tried .
INFJ	The republican is the only form of government which is not eternally at open or secret war with the rights of mankind .
INFJ	Were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers , or newspapers without a government , I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter .
INFJ	The spirit of resistance to government is so valuable on certain occasions that I wish it to be always kept alive .
INFJ	Sometimes it is said that man can not be trusted with the government of himself . Can he , then be trusted with the government of others ? Or have we found angels in the form of kings to govern him ? Let history answer this question .
INFJ	History , in general , only informs us of what bad government is .
ISTJ	In the councils of government , we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence , whether sought or unsought , by the military-industrial complex . The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist .
ESTP	When I am abroad , I always make it a rule never to criticize or attack the government of my own country . I make up for lost time when I come home .
INFJ	The natural progress of things is for liberty to yield and government to gain ground .
INFJ	Conquest is not in our principles . It is inconsistent with our government .
INTJ	Potentially , a government is the most dangerous threat to man 's rights : it holds a legal monopoly on the use of physical force against legally disarmed victims .
ESFP	Democracy is worth dying for , because it 's the most deeply honorable form of government ever devised by man .
INFJ	I own that I am not a friend to a very energetic government . It is always oppressive .
INFJ	So confident am I in the intentions , as well as wisdom , of the government , that I shall always be satisfied that what is not done , either can not , or ought not to be done .
INFJ	That government is the strongest of which every man feels himself a part .
INFJ	No government ought to be without censors and where the press is free no one ever will .
ESTP	Behind the ostensible government sits enthroned an invisible government owing no allegiance and acknowledging no responsibility to the people .
ESFP	The taxpayer - that 's someone who works for the federal government but does n't have to take the civil service examination .
INFJ	The second office in the government is honorable and easy the first is but a splendid misery .
ESFP	Government always finds a need for whatever money it gets .
ESFP	One way to make sure crime does n't pay would be to let the government run it .
ESFP	Protecting the rights of even the least individual among us is basically the only excuse the government has for even existing .
ISTJ	Over grown military establishments are under any form of government inauspicious to liberty , and are to be regarded as particularly hostile to republican liberty .
INTJ	The only power any government has is the power to crack down on criminals . Well , when there are n't enough criminals , one makes them . One declares so many things to be a crime that it becomes impossible for men to live without breaking laws .
ESFP	Today , if you invent a better mousetrap , the government comes along with a better mouse .
ISTJ	I think that people want peace so much that one of these days government had better get out of their way and let them have it .
ENTJ	Different men seek after happiness in different ways and by different means , and so make for themselves different modes of life and forms of government .
ISTJ	The basis of our political system is the right of the people to make and to alter their constitutions of government .
ISTP	When the federal government spends more each year than it collects in tax revenues , it has three choices : It can raise taxes , print money , or borrow money . While these actions may benefit politicians , all three options are bad for average Americans .
ENTP	If the people can not trust their government to do the job for which it exists - to protect them and to promote their common welfare - all else is lost .
ISTJ	Mankind , when left to themselves , are unfit for their own government .
ISTP	If you like small government you need to work hard at having a strong national defense that is not so militant . Personal liberty is the purpose of government , to protect liberty - not to run your personal life , not to run the economy , and not to pretend that we can tell the world how they ought to live .
INFP	By definition , a government has no conscience . Sometimes it has a policy , but nothing more .
ISTJ	It may be laid down as a primary position , and the basis of our system , that every Citizen who enjoys the protection of a Free Government , owes not only a proportion of his property , but even of his personal services to the defense of it .
ESTP	The government is us we are the government , you and I .
ISTJ	The administration of justice is the firmest pillar of government .
INTP	Do not separate text from historical background . If you do , you will have perverted and subverted the Constitution , which can only end in a distorted , bastardized form of illegitimate government .
ENTP	An ideal form of government is democracy tempered with assassination .
ENTJ	It 's not tyranny we desire it 's a just , limited , federal government .
ISTP	I believe there is something out there watching us . Unfortunately , it 's the government .
ISFJ	Now , let me be clear . The path I lay out is not one paved with ever increasing government checks and cradle to grave assurance that government will always be the solution . If this election is a bidding war for who can promise the most goodies and the most benefits , I 'm not your president . You have that president today .
ENFJ	There are many people who feel that it is useless and futile to continue talking about peace and non-violence against a government whose only reply is savage attacks on an unarmed and defenceless people .
INTP	Many people want the government to protect the consumer . A much more urgent problem is to protect the consumer from the government .
INTJ	There is danger from all men . The only maxim of a free government ought to be to trust no man living with power to endanger the public liberty .
ISFJ	I spent my whole life in the private sector , 25 years in the private sector . I understand that when government takes more money out of the hands of people , it makes it more difficult for them to buy things . If they ca n't buy things , the economy does n't grow . If the economy does n't grow , we do n't put Americans to work .
INTP	The Great Depression , like most other periods of severe unemployment , was produced by government mismanagement rather than by any inherent instability of the private economy .
ENTJ	I am sometimes a fox and sometimes a lion . The whole secret of government lies in knowing when to be the one or the other .
ISTP	When one gets in bed with government , one must expect the diseases it spreads .
ISTP	I am absolutely opposed to a national ID card . This is a total contradiction of what a free society is all about . The purpose of government is to protect the secrecy and the privacy of all individuals , not the secrecy of government . We do n't need a national ID card .
ENTP	The Internet did n't get invented on its own . Government research created the Internet so that all the companies could make money off the Internet . The point is , is that when we succeed , we succeed because of our individual initiative , but also because we do things together .
INTJ	The happiness of society is the end of government .
ENTP	The ideal form of government is democracy tempered with assassination .
ISFJ	Government is taking 40 percent of the GDP . And that 's at the state , local and federal level . President Obama has taken government spending at the federal level from 20 percent to 25 percent . Look , at some point , you cease being a free economy , and you become a government economy . And we 've got to stop that .
ISTP	I 'm not really conservative . I 'm conservative on certain things . I believe in less government . I believe in fiscal responsibility and all those things that maybe Republicans used to believe in but do n't any more .
ISTP	There is nothing wrong with describing Conservatism as protecting the Constitution , protecting all things that limit government . Government is the enemy of liberty . Government should be very restrained .
ISFJ	And a special thank you to the citizens of Massachusetts : You are paying all the taxes , creating all the jobs , raising all the children . This government is yours . Thank you for letting me serve you . I love this job .
INTP	The world runs on individuals pursuing their self interests . The great achievements of civilization have not come from government bureaus . Einstein did n't construct his theory under order from a , from a bureaucrat . Henry Ford did n't revolutionize the automobile industry that way .
ISFJ	Free enterprise has done more to lift people out of poverty , to help build a strong middle class , to help educate our kids , and to make our lives better than all the programs of government combined .
ESTP	The United States Constitution has proved itself the most marvelously elastic compilation of rules of government ever written .
INTJ	Liberty has never come from Government . Liberty has always come from the subjects of it . The history of liberty is a history of limitations of governmental power , not the increase of it .
ENTJ	Why has government been instituted at all ? Because the passions of man will not conform to the dictates of reason and justice without constraint .
ISTP	Just think of what Woodrow Wilson stood for : he stood for world government . He wanted an early United Nations , League of Nations . But it was the conservatives , Republicans , that stood up against him .
INTP	Nothing is so permanent as a temporary government program .
ISFJ	The right way to reign in healthcare costs is not by applying more government and more controls and making it more like the post office , it 's by making it more like a consumer-driven market .
ISFJ	You balance the budget by restraining the growth of government and encouraging the growth of the private sector .
ISFJ	By making bold cuts in spending and commonsense entitlement reforms , we will make our government simpler , smaller , and smarter .
ISFJ	It 's opportunity . It 's opportunity , not a check from government - it 's opportunity that has always driven America and defined us as Americans .
ISFJ	The answer for healthcare is market incentives , not healthcare by a Godzilla-sized government bureaucracy .
ISFJ	I would cap the amount of federal government can spend at 20 percent of the economy . Bring it back to 20 percent or lower . And say , we are not going to spend above that level . Democrats , they want to raise your taxes and spend more and more and turn us into an economy which is no longer driven by the private sector .
ISFJ	Our nation is too different , too diverse to say that what works in Massachusetts is somehow going to be grabbed by the federal government , usurping the power of states and imposing a one-size-fits-all plan on the nation . That will not work .
ISFJ	On one of the most personal matters of our lives , our health care , President Obama would turn decision making over to government bureaucrats . He forced through Obama-care and I will repeal it .
ISFJ	Democrats want to use the slowdown as an excuse to do what their special interests are always begging for : higher taxes , bigger government and less trade with other nations .
ESTP	No government can help the destinies of people who insist in putting sectional and class consciousness ahead of general weal .
ISTP	I had the privilege of practicing medicine in the early '60s , before we had any government . It worked rather well , and there was nobody on the street suffering with no medical care .
ENTJ	Well private money can take risks in a way that government money often is n't willing to .
ENTP	All government , indeed every human benefit and enjoyment , every virtue , and every prudent act , is founded on compromise and barter .
ESTP	Government does not create wealth . The major role for the government is to create an environment where people take risks to expand the job rate in the United States .
INTP	Most of the energy of political work is devoted to correcting the effects of mismanagement of government .
INTJ	A government of laws , and not of men .
ESFJ	Those who want the Government to regulate matters of the mind and spirit are like men who are so afraid of being murdered that they commit suicide to avoid assassination .
ENTJ	Even to observe neutrality you must have a strong government .
ESTP	We are beginning a new era in our government . I can not too strongly urge the necessity of a rigid economy and an inflexible determination not to enlarge the income beyond the real necessities of the government .
ESFJ	The federal government has sponsored research that has produced a tomato that is perfect in every respect , except that you ca n't eat it . We should make every effort to make sure this disease , often referred to as 'progress ' , does n't spread .
ESTJ	As I speak to you today , government censors somewhere are working furiously to erase my words from the records of history . But history itself has already condemned these tactics .
INTJ	A little group of willful men , representing no opinion but their own , have rendered the great government of the United States helpless and contemptible .
ESTJ	One of my goals upon becoming Secretary of State was to take diplomacy out of capitals , out of government offices , into the media , into the streets of countries .
ESTJ	The nuclear arsenal that Pakistan has , I believe is secure . I think the government and the military have taken adequate steps to protect that .
INFJ	If you are working 50 hours a week in a factory , you do n't have time to read 10 newspapers a day and go back to declassified government archives . But such people may have far-reaching insights into the way the world works .
ENTP	Nothing turns out to be so oppressive and unjust as a feeble government .
ENTJ	You know why there 's a Second Amendment ? In case the government fails to follow the first one .
INTJ	While all other sciences have advanced , that of government is at a standstill - little better understood , little better practiced now than three or four thousand years ago .
ESFJ	I do n't think the government is out to get me or help someone else get me but it would n't surprise me if they were out to sell me something or help someone else sell me something . I mean , why else would the Census Bureau want to know my telephone number ?
INTP	And I have no doubt that every new example will succeed , as every past one has done , in showing that religion and Government will both exist in greater purity , the less they are mixed together .
ESTP	As long as our government is administered for the good of the people , and is regulated by their will as long as it secures to us the rights of persons and of property , liberty of conscience and of the press , it will be worth defending .
INTP	The black market was a way of getting around government controls . It was a way of enabling the free market to work . It was a way of opening up , enabling people .
INTP	A popular government without popular information or the means of acquiring it , is but a prologue to a farce , or a tragedy , or perhaps both .
INTJ	The essence of a free government consists in an effectual control of rivalries .
ISTJ	The government of the United States is a device for maintaining in perpetuity the rights of the people , with the ultimate extinction of all privileged classes .
ESTP	Any government that supports , protects or harbours terrorists is complicit in the murder of the innocent and equally guilty of terrorist crimes .
INTP	War should only be declared by the authority of the people , whose toils and treasures are to support its burdens , instead of the government which is to reap its fruits .
ESTP	I know it 's going to be the private sector that leads this country out of the current economic times we 're in . You can spend your money better than the government can spend your money .
ESFJ	I hope all of you are going to fill out your census form when it comes in the mail next month . If you do n't return the form the area you live in might get less government money and you would n't want that to happen , would you .
ESFJ	A President needs political understanding to run the government , but he may be elected without it .
ESFJ	We need to understand that we as citizens and as a government in any community throughout this country have no more important obligation than to educate those who are going to replace us .
ESFJ	When you have an efficient government , you have a dictatorship .
INTJ	Government 's first duty and highest obligation is public safety .
INTJ	By a continuing process of inflation , government can confiscate , secretly and unobserved , an important part of the wealth of their citizens .
ESFJ	When you decide to get involved in a military operation in a place like Syria , you 've got to be prepared , as we learned from Iraq and Afghanistan , to become the government , and I 'm not sure any country , either the United States or I do n't hear of anyone else , who 's willing to take on that responsibility .
INTP	The most important ways in which I think the Internet will affect the big issue is that it will make it more difficult for government to collect taxes .
INTP	I have no doubt but that the misery of the lower classes will be found to abate whenever the Government assumes a freer aspect and the laws favor a subdivision of Property .
INTP	The people are the only legitimate fountain of power , and it is from them that the constitutional charter , under which the several branches of government hold their power , is derived .
ESFJ	We got rid of a terrible dictator . We gave the Iraqi people an opportunity for a new life under a representative form of government .
ESFJ	We all hoped in 2001 that we could put in place an Afghan government under President Karzai that would be able to control the country , make sure al-Qaeda did n't come back , and make sure the Taliban was n't resurging . It did n't work out .
ESTP	Money is power , and in that government which pays all the public officers of the states will all political power be substantially concentrated .
INTP	Government has no other end , but the preservation of property .
INTP	The essence of Government is power and power , lodged as it must be in human hands , will ever be liable to abuse .
INTJ	To restore the trust of the people , we must reform the way the government operates .
INTP	In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men you must first enable the government to control the governed and in the next place oblige it to control itself .
INTJ	We are a forward-looking people , and we must have a forward-looking government .
INTJ	I feel good because I believe I have made progress in rebuilding the people 's trust in their government .
INTJ	As president , Reagan worked very well with Democrats to do big things . It is true that he worked to reduce the size of government and cut federal taxes and he eliminated many regulations , but he also raised taxes when necessary .
INTP	The diversity in the faculties of men , from which the rights of property originate , is not less an insuperable obstacle to an uniformity of interests . The protection of these faculties is the first object of government .
INTP	What is government itself but the greatest of all reflections on human nature ? If men were angels , no government would be necessary . If angels were to govern men , neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary .
INTP	To suppose that any form of government will secure liberty or happiness without any virtue in the people , is a chimerical idea .
ESFJ	A politician is a man who understands government . A statesman is a politician who 's been dead for 15 years .
INTP	A pure democracy is a society consisting of a small number of citizens , who assemble and administer the government in person .
ESTP	There are no necessary evils in government . Its evils exist only in its abuses .
INTP	The rights of persons , and the rights of property , are the objects , for the protection of which Government was instituted .
ENTJ	Barack Obama 's enemies are the people who make this country work . Barack Obama 's enemies are those who succeed . Those are the people whose income he wants to redistribute . Those are the people whose income he wants to take , using the power and the force of the federal government to do it .
INTP	Religion flourishes in greater purity , without than with the aid of Government .
ESFP	Everything government touches turns to crap .
ESTP	I can not consent that my mortal body shall be laid in a repository prepared for an Emperor or a King my republican feelings and principles forbid it the simplicity of our system of government forbids it .
ESTP	We should reject big government and look inside ourselves for all the things that built this country into what it was .
ESTJ	The control of information is something the elite always does , particularly in a despotic form of government . Information , knowledge , is power . If you can control information , you can control people .
ESTP	People forget ... that we structured it so that the government , or the people , would be repaid with a really good rate of return . And as it turns out , that aspect of TARP , that 's what happened .
ENTJ	That 's the definition of 'success ' for the modern Democrat Party . As many people dependent on government as possible is the objective .
ENTJ	You could afford your house without the government if it were n't for the government .
ENTJ	Liberal Democrats are inexorably opposed to tax cuts , because tax cuts give people more power , and take away from the role of government .

ESTP	I think Ronald Reagan was one of the great presidents , period , not just recently . I thought he had the demeanor . I thought he had the bearing . I thought he had the thought process .
ESTP	People might not think that , but the Republicans have all of the cards . And this is the time to get rid of Obamacare . This is the time to make the great deal .
ESTP	So Bush certainly was n't the greatest , and Obama has not done the job . And he 's created a lot of disincentive . He 's created a lot of great dissatisfaction . Regulations and regulatory is going through the roof . It 's almost impossible to get anything done in the country .
ESTP	I do have my ducks in line if I want to do it , but I 'd love to see the Republicans pick somebody that was going to win and take over this country and frankly , to use the expression , 'Make America great again . '
ESTP	A lot of people feel very good about Mitt Romney and I think he 's going to do a great job .
ESTP	Mitt - what I speak to Mitt Romney about is jobs . What I speak to Mitt Romney about is China , because he 's got a great view on China and how they 're trying to destroy our country by taking our jobs and making our product and manipulating their currency , so that it makes it almost impossible for our companies to compete .
ESTP	It 's a great thing when you can show that you 've been successful and that you 've made a lot of money and that you 've employed a lot of people .
ESTP	Obama has no solutions . Obama has failed the country and its great citizens , and they do n't like it when somebody such as myself speaks the truth about this - it hurts too much .
ESFJ	In other words , do n't expect to always be great . Disappointments , failures and setbacks are a normal part of the lifecycle of a unit or a company and what the leader has to do is constantly be up and say 'we have a problem , let 's go and get it ' .
ENTP	I think one of the great problems we have in the Republican Party is that we do n't encourage you to be nasty . We encourage you to be neat , obedient , loyal and faithful and all those Boy Scout words , which would be great around a campfire but are lousy in politics .
ENFJ	Rock 'n ' roll is ridiculous . It 's absurd . In the past , U2 was trying to duck that . Now we 're wrapping our arms around it and giving it a great big kiss .
ENTJ	Fortune , which has a great deal of power in other matters but especially in war , can bring about great changes in a situation through very slight forces .
ESTP	The great gift of human beings is that we have the power of empathy .
ISFP	When you are happy you can forgive a great deal .
ESTJ	The essence of America - that which really unites us - is not ethnicity , or nationality or religion - it is an idea - and what an idea it is : That you can come from humble circumstances and do great things .
ISTJ	When a great many people are unable to find work , unemployment results .
ESFJ	Would n't it be great if we could look forward to a whole world in which no child will be left behind ?
INFP	The machine does not isolate man from the great problems of nature but plunges him more deeply into them .
ENTJ	I really think that there was a great advantage in many ways to being a woman . I think we are a lot better at personal relationships , and then have the capability obviously of telling it like it is when it 's necessary .
INTP	It is of great use to the sailor to know the length of his line , though he can not with it fathom all the depths of the ocean .
ENTJ	Police and firefighters are great , but they do n't create wealth . They protect it . That 's crucial . Teaching is a wonderful profession . Teachers help educate people to become good citizens so that citizens can then go create wealth . But they do n't create the wealth themselves .
INFJ	Do n't get involved in partial problems , but always take flight to where there is a free view over the whole single great problem , even if this view is still not a clear one .
ISTJ	Advertising ministers to the spiritual side of trade . It is great power that has been entrusted to your keeping which charges you with the high responsibility of inspiring and ennobling the commercial world . It is all part of the greater work of the regeneration and redemption of mankind .
INFP	What 's great about this country is that America started the tradition where the richest consumers buy essentially the same things as the poorest .
ISFP	It 's great to be here . It 's great to be anywhere .
ISFP	It is great to be a blonde . With low expectations it 's very easy to surprise people .
ISTP	The great nations have always acted like gangsters , and the small nations like prostitutes .
INFJ	If I had my way , if I was lucky enough , if I could be on the brink my entire life - that great sense of expectation and excitement without the disappointment - that would be the perfect state .
INTJ	High moral character is not a precondition for great moral accomplishments .
INFJ	I do n't think actors should ever expect to get a role , because the disappointment is too great . You 've got to think of things as an opportunity . An audition 's an opportunity to have an audience .
ISTP	I love what I do . I take great pride in what I do . And I ca n't do something halfway , three-quarters , nine-tenths . If I 'm going to do something , I go all the way .
ISTJ	I tell students that even if they do n't like math right now , they can use math as a brain-sharpening tool - a tool that not only builds the foundation for a great career , but that also builds self-confidence , no matter what they choose to do with their lives .
ENFP	You are that vast thing that you see far , far off with great telescopes .
INTJ	I speak directly to the people , and I know that the people of California want to have better leadership . They want to have great leadership . They want to have somebody that will represent them . And it does n't matter if you 're a Democrat or a Republican , young or old .
INTJ	When I meet people who say - which they do all of the time - 'I must just tell you , my great aunt had cancer of the elbow and the doctors gave her 10 seconds to live , but last I heard she was climbing Mount Everest , ' and so forth , I switch off quite early .
ESTJ	Children are our second chance to have a great parent-child relationship .
INTJ	One of the great questions of philosophy is , do we innately have morality , or do we get it from celestial dictation ? A study of the Ten Commandments is a very good way of getting into and resolving that issue .
INTJ	The great thing about the United States and the historically magnetic effect it has had on a lot of people like me is its generosity , to put it simply .
INFJ	Technology has advanced more in the last thirty years than in the previous two thousand . The exponential increase in advancement will only continue . Anthropological Commentary The opposite of a trivial truth is false the opposite of a great truth is also true .
INTP	Science is the great antidote to the poison of enthusiasm and superstition .
INTP	Most folks are as happy as they make up their minds to be .
INFJ	Happiness is when what you think , what you say , and what you do are in harmony .
ENFP	Some cause happiness wherever they go others whenever they go .
INTP	A table , a chair , a bowl of fruit and a violin what else does a man need to be happy ?
INFP	True happiness comes from the joy of deeds well done , the zest of creating things new .
ENTP	The Constitution only gives people the right to pursue happiness . You have to catch it yourself .
INTJ	Achievement of your happiness is the only moral purpose of your life , and that happiness , not pain or mindless self-indulgence , is the proof of your moral integrity , since it is the proof and the result of your loyalty to the achievement of your values .
ENTJ	Happiness depends upon ourselves .
INFJ	We hold these truths to be self-evident : that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness .
ISFJ	The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts : therefore , guard accordingly , and take care that you entertain no notions unsuitable to virtue and reasonable nature .
ESTP	Happiness in intelligent people is the rarest thing I know .
ENFP	There are people who can do all fine and heroic things but one - keep from telling their happiness to the unhappy .
INFJ	It is neither wealth nor splendor but tranquility and occupation which give you happiness .
INFP	But what is happiness except the simple harmony between a man and the life he leads ?
ENTP	To be without some of the things you want is an indispensable part of happiness .
INFP	Your successes and happiness are forgiven you only if you generously consent to share them .
INTJ	Happiness is that state of consciousness which proceeds from the achievement of one 's values .
INFJ	All happiness or unhappiness solely depends upon the quality of the object to which we are attached by love .
ESFP	Happiness is a continuation of happenings which are not resisted .
ESFJ	Happiness depends more on how life strikes you than on what happens .
ENFP	There is something curiously boring about somebody else 's happiness .
ISFP	Nothing brings me more happiness than trying to help the most vulnerable people in society . It is a goal and an essential part of my life - a kind of destiny . Whoever is in distress can call on me . I will come running wherever they are .
ESTP	Happiness is ideal , it is the work of the imagination .
INFJ	Happiness does not lie in happiness , but in the achievement of it .
INTP	Happiness never lays its finger on its pulse .
ENTP	Unquestionably , it is possible to do without happiness it is done involuntarily by nineteen-twentieths of mankind .
INFJ	Happiness is a virtue , not its reward .
INFP	You will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of . You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life .
ENTP	The U. S. Constitution does n't guarantee happiness , only the pursuit of it . You have to catch up with it yourself .
ENTP	Money has never made man happy , nor will it , there is nothing in its nature to produce happiness . The more of it one has the more one wants .
ISTJ	Happiness and moral duty are inseparably connected .
INFP	But O , how bitter a thing it is to look into happiness through another man 's eyes .
ISFP	I heard a definition once : Happiness is health and a short memory ! I wish I 'd invented it , because it is very true .
INFJ	Happiness is not being pained in body or troubled in mind .
ESTP	Success is getting what you want . Happiness is wanting what you get .
INFJ	Man falls from the pursuit of the ideal of plan living and high thinking the moment he wants to multiply his daily wants . Man 's happiness really lies in contentment .
ESTP	Are you bored with life ? Then throw yourself into some work you believe in with all your heart , live for it , die for it , and you will find happiness that you had thought could never be yours .
ENTJ	Politicians also have no leisure , because they are always aiming at something beyond political life itself , power and glory , or happiness .
ESTP	Happiness lies in the joy of achievement and the thrill of creative effort .
INFP	Happiness can exist only in acceptance .
ESTP	Remember happiness does n't depend upon who you are or what you have it depends solely on what you think .
ESTJ	There is joy in work . There is no happiness except in the realization that we have accomplished something .
ESTJ	Wealth , like happiness , is never attained when sought after directly . It comes as a by-product of providing a useful service .
ESTP	The person who seeks all their applause from outside has their happiness in another 's keeping .
ENTP	The secret of happiness is this : let your interests be as wide as possible , and let your reactions to the things and persons that interest you be as far as possible friendly rather than hostile .
ENTP	The secret to happiness is to face the fact that the world is horrible .
INFJ	There is no greater sorrow than to recall happiness in times of misery .
ENTP	I 've made an odd discovery . Every time I talk to a savant I feel quite sure that happiness is no longer a possibility . Yet when I talk with my gardener , I 'm convinced of the opposite .
ENTP	Contempt for happiness is usually contempt for other people 's happiness , and is an elegant disguise for hatred of the human race .
ISTJ	What we call happiness in the strictest sense comes from the ( preferably sudden ) satisfaction of needs which have been dammed up to a high degree .
ENTP	If there were in the world today any large number of people who desired their own happiness more than they desired the unhappiness of others , we could have a paradise in a few years .
INTJ	The first requisite for the happiness of the people is the abolition of religion .
ENFP	Happiness is a hard master , particularly other people 's happiness .
ENTP	If all our happiness is bound up entirely in our personal circumstances it is difficult not to demand of life more than it has to give .
INTP	Morality is not the doctrine of how we may make ourselves happy , but how we may make ourselves worthy of happiness .
INFP	Men can only be happy when they do not assume that the object of life is happiness .
ENTP	Of all forms of caution , caution in love is perhaps the most fatal to true happiness .
INFP	Fun I love , but too much fun is of all things the most loathsome . Mirth is better than fun , and happiness is better than mirth .
INTP	Happiness is not an ideal of reason , but of imagination .
INFJ	Man is fond of counting his troubles , but he does not count his joys . If he counted them up as he ought to , he would see that every lot has enough happiness provided for it .
INFJ	No man chooses evil because it is evil he only mistakes it for happiness , the good he seeks .
ISFJ	Why love if losing hurts so much ? I have no answers anymore only the life I have lived . The pain now is part of the happiness then .
ESTP	Happiness lies neither in vice nor in virtue but in the manner we appreciate the one and the other , and the choice we make pursuant to our individual organization .
INFP	The man who is aware of himself is henceforward independent and he is never bored , and life is only too short , and he is steeped through and through with a profound yet temperate happiness .
ENTP	I have learned to seek my happiness by limiting my desires , rather than in attempting to satisfy them .

INTJ	Our envy always lasts longer than the happiness of those we envy .
ESTP	I have this really high priority on happiness and finding something to be happy about .
ISFJ	I refuse to accept other people 's ideas of happiness for me . As if there 's a 'one size fits all ' standard for happiness .
INTP	A sincere and steadfast co-operation in promoting such a reconstruction of our political system as would provide for the permanent liberty and happiness of the United States .
INFP	Happiness : a good bank account , a good cook , and a good digestion .
ESFP	My whole thing is to agree to disagree and to have respect because nothing can really be changed and you would n't want to ruin their happiness - even if that happiness is ignorance .
ENTP	Actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness . By happiness is intended pleasure and the absence of pain .
INFP	In theory there is a possibility of perfect happiness : To believe in the indestructible element within one , and not to strive towards it .
ISFJ	For this generation , ours , life is nuclear survival , liberty is human rights , the pursuit of happiness is a planet whose resources are devoted to the physical and spiritual nourishment of its inhabitants .
ENTP	But happiness is no respecter of persons .
INTP	The ultimate end of human acts is eudaimonia , happiness in the sense of living well , which all men desire all acts are but different means chosen to arrive at it .
INTP	What can be added to the happiness of a man who is in health , out of debt , and has a clear conscience ?
ENTP	Happiness is no respecter of persons .
ESTP	No one is guaranteed happiness . You can pursue it , but if you happen to find success along the way on that road to happiness , Conservatives believe you should not be demonized or penalized for it .
ESFP	So , my happiness does n't come from money or fame . My happiness comes from seeing life without struggle .
ISFP	For me , love is happiness and inspiration .
ESTJ	One thing I 've been happy as peach pie about - because I 'm all about the children and the happiness of a woman because that makes the happiness of the home - is that nannies , day cares and babysitters are all collapsing , which is forcing moms and dads to raise their children at home .
ESFP	I think a child may be the only thing that could give me true happiness .
ESFP	My happiness does n't come from money or fame . My happiness comes from seeing life without struggle .
ESFP	My greatest happiness is to serve my gracious King and Country and I am envious only of glory for if it be a sin to covet glory I am the most offending soul alive .
ENTP	I was as happy doing theater in New York for little or no money as I am now doing television for more money . The happiness , I guess , comes out of it being a good job . The success has to do with the fact that it 's a good job that will continue .
ISFP	The applause was so loud and insistent that I had to respond with several encores . I was numb with happiness , when it was over , I knew that this alone must be my life and my world .
ESFP	The way you think , the way you behave , the way you eat , can influence your life by 30 to 50 years .
ESFP	I made a commitment to completely cut out drinking and anything that might hamper me from getting my mind and body together . And the floodgates of goodness have opened upon me - spiritually and financially .
ESTJ	We can make a commitment to promote vegetables and fruits and whole grains on every part of every menu . We can make portion sizes smaller and emphasize quality over quantity . And we can help create a culture - imagine this - where our kids ask for healthy options instead of resisting them .
INTJ	My body is like breakfast , lunch , and dinner . I do n't think about it , I just have it .
INTP	The devil has put a penalty on all things we enjoy in life . Either we suffer in health or we suffer in soul or we get fat .
ENFP	Be careful about reading health books . You may die of a misprint .
ENFP	The only way to keep your health is to eat what you do n't want , drink what you do n't like , and do what you 'd rather not .
ESTJ	When wealth is lost , nothing is lost when health is lost , something is lost when character is lost , all is lost .
ENTP	After a century of striving , after a year of debate , after a historic vote , health care reform is no longer an unmet promise . It is the law of the land .
ENTP	And so our goal on health care is , if we can get , instead of health care costs going up 6 percent a year , it 's going up at the level of inflation , maybe just slightly above inflation , we 've made huge progress . And by the way , that is the single most important thing we could do in terms of reducing our deficit . That 's why we did it .
ENTJ	Obama 's health care plan will be written by a committee whose head , John Conyers , says he does n't understand it . It 'll be passed by Congress that has not read it , signed by a president who smokes , funded by a Treasury chief who did n't pay his taxes , overseen by a Surgeon General who is obese , and financed by a country that 's nearly broke . What could possibly go wrong ?
ENTP	But if you - if what - the reports are true , what they 're saying is , is that as a consequence of us getting 30 million additional people health care , at the margins that 's going to increase our costs , we knew that .
ESTJ	Women in particular need to keep an eye on their physical and mental health , because if we 're scurrying to and from appointments and errands , we do n't have a lot of time to take care of ourselves . We need to do a better job of putting ourselves higher on our own 'to do ' list .
ENFP	Addiction should never be treated as a crime . It has to be treated as a health problem . We do not send alcoholics to jail in this country . Over 500,000 people are in our jails who are nonviolent drug users .
ISTP	Overnight stardom can be harmful to your mental health . Yeah . It has ruined a lot of people .
INTP	All mankind ... being all equal and independent , no one ought to harm another in his life , health , liberty or possessions .
INTJ	Capital is reckless of the health or length of life of the laborer , unless under compulsion from society .
ESFJ	The chief condition on which , life , health and vigor depend on , is action . It is by action that an organism develops its faculties , increases its energy , and attains the fulfillment of its destiny .
ENTP	If you can be well without health , you may be happy without virtue .
ESTP	I support health care for people . I want people well taken care of . But I also want health care that we can afford as a country . I have people and friends closing down their businesses because of Obamacare .
INTJ	I believe in universal health care . And I am not afraid to say so .
ENFP	I 've never had very high regard for therapists . I owe my health , my mental survival , to my friends and loved ones .
ISFJ	The awareness that health is dependent upon habits that we control makes us the first generation in history that to a large extent determines its own destiny .
ESFP	In societies where mature workers are respected and where their wisdom is respected , everybody benefits . Workers are more engaged and productive . Their health is better . They live longer .
ESTJ	When it comes to the health of our families , Barack refused to listen to all those folks who told him to leave health reform for another day , another president . He did n't care whether it was the easy thing to do politically - that 's not how he was raised - he cared that it was the right thing to do .
ESTP	It 's bizarre that the produce manager is more important to my children 's health than the pediatrician .
ISFJ	The fact is that we would have had comprehensive health care now , had it not been for Ted Kennedy 's deliberately blocking the legislation that I proposed in 1978 or '79 .
ISFJ	I think all Americans believe in human rights . And health is an often overlooked aspect of basic human rights . And it 's one that 's easily corrected . The reason I say that is that many of the diseases that we treat around the world , I knew when I was a child . My mother was a registered nurse . And they no longer exist in our country .
ENTP	I think it 's horrible that people have to be told . Do n't smoke ! Everybody knows it 's bad for the health . But they have to forbid it .
ENTP	There are less than 1 per cent of anorexic girls , but there more than 30 per cent of girls in France - I do n't know about England - that are much , much overweight . And it is much more dangerous and very bad for the health .
ENFJ	America does n't have health insurance .
ENTJ	In order to lead a country or a company , you 've got to get everybody on the same page and you 've got to be able to have a vision of where you 're going . America ca n't have a vision of health care for everybody , green economy , regulations - ca n't have a bunch of piece-meal activities . It 's got to have a vision .
ENFJ	If I were a capitalist I would not give my employees health insurance with no deductible , which I do , including dental , and paid pregnancy leave . That 's not called capitalism , that 's called being a Christian and someone who believes in democracy , so that everyone should get a fair slice of the pie .
ENTJ	Dick Cheney said he was running again . He said his health was fine , 'I 've got a doctor with me 24 hours a day . ' Yeah , that 's always the sign of a man in good health , is n't it ?
ENTJ	Think of an economy where people could be an artist or a photographer or a writer without worrying about keeping their day job in order to have health insurance .
ENTJ	I think about my parents all the time , especially on Sunday when I 'm at Mass . My mother always said , 'We do not pray to win elections . We pray for people 's health , we pray that God 's will be done , we pray that we do our best . But we do not pray to win elections . '
ENTJ	Because of the president 's leadership , every American will have access to affordable , quality health care .
ESFJ	Make no mistake , a 'yes ' vote on the Democrats ' health care bill is a vote for taxpayer-funded abortions .
ESFP	The public health of five million children should not be left to luck or chance .
ESTJ	Well , the truth is that a lot of people lie about their health , they lie about the finances , they lie about things at work , they lie about things .
ESTJ	When bureaucrats talk about increasing our 'access ' to x , y or z , what they 're really talking about is increasing exponentially their control over our lives . As it is with the government health care takeover , so it is with the newly approved government plan to 'increase ' Internet 'access . '
ESTJ	For the past two years , President Obama has promised our children the moon , stars , rainbows , unicorns and universal health care for all . But the White House Santa 's cradle-to-grave entitlement mandates are a spectacularly predictable bust .
ESFP	If Obama wanted to make radical changes to America 's health long-term , all he has to do is treble the price of sugar and salt .
INTJ	I admit it : I had fun watching right-wingers go wild as health reform finally became law .
ESFP	I am in very good health . I 've never felt better .
INTP	If your access to health care involves your leaving work and driving somewhere and parking and waiting for a long time , that 's not going to promote healthiness .
INTP	The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present . The occasion is piled high with difficulty , and we must rise with the occasion . As our case is new , so we must think anew and act anew .
ESTP	The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much it is whether we provide enough for those who have little .
ENFP	The very ink with which history is written is merely fluid prejudice .
ESTP	History will be kind to me for I intend to write it .
ESTP	Study history , study history . In history lies all the secrets of statecraft .
ESFJ	If you are neutral in situations of injustice , you have chosen the side of the oppressor . If an elephant has its foot on the tail of a mouse and you say that you are neutral , the mouse will not appreciate your neutrality .
ESFP	If we can not now end our differences , at least we can help make the world safe for diversity .
ESFP	We would like to live as we once lived , but history will not permit it .
ENTJ	Democratic nations must try to find ways to starve the terrorist and the hijacker of the oxygen of publicity on which they depend .
ENTJ	I came , I saw , I conquered .
ENTJ	A world without nuclear weapons would be less stable and more dangerous for all of us .
ENTP	Those who do n't know history are destined to repeat it .
ESTP	A pint of sweat , saves a gallon of blood .
ESTP	Americans love to fight . All real Americans love the sting of battle .
ESTJ	History is more or less bunk .
ENFP	That men do not learn very much from the lessons of history is the most important of all the lessons of history .
ENTJ	History is the version of past events that people have decided to agree upon .
ESTP	If one morning I walked on top of the water across the Potomac River , the headline that afternoon would read : 'President Ca n't Swim . '
ENTJ	What is history but a fable agreed upon ?
ENTJ	Glory is fleeting , but obscurity is forever .
ESFJ	The Marine Corps is the Navy 's police force and as long as I am President that is what it will remain . They have a propaganda machine that is almost equal to Stalin 's .
ESTP	Being president is like being a jackass in a hailstorm . There 's nothing to do but to stand there and take it .
ISTJ	The most terrible job in warfare is to be a second lieutenant leading a platoon when you are on the battlefield .
ESFJ	90 percent of my time is spent on 10 percent of the world .
ISTJ	I have noticed that nothing I never said ever did me any harm .
ESTP	They died hard , those savage men - like wounded wolves at bay . They were filthy , and they were lousy , and they stunk . And I loved them .
ESTP	The greater the difficulty , the more the glory in surmounting it .
ESTP	The deliberate and deadly attacks which were carried out yesterday against our country were more than acts of terror . They were acts of war .
ESTP	Could I have but a line a century hence crediting a contribution to the advance of peace , I would yield every honor which has been accorded by war .
INFJ	Be as a tower firmly set Shakes not its top for any blast that blows .
INTJ	The man who is swimming against the stream knows the strength of it .
ENFJ	We , therefore , here in Britain stand shoulder to shoulder with our American friends in this hour of tragedy , and we , like them , will not rest until this evil is driven from our world .
ISFJ	Something as curious as the monarchy wo n't survive unless you take account of people 's attitudes . After all , if people do n't want it , they wo n't have it .
ENFJ	We are not makers of history . We are made by history .
INFJ	Among the many misdeeds of the British rule in India , history will look upon the act depriving a whole nation of arms as the blackest .
ESTP	History is written by the victors .
ESTP	For my part , I consider that it will be found much better by all parties to leave the past to history , especially as I propose to write that history myself .
INTJ	History repeats itself , first as tragedy , second as farce .
INFJ	Violent men have not been known in history to die to a man . They die up to a point .
ESFP	History teaches that war begins when governments believe the price of aggression is cheap .
ENTJ	Poetry is finer and more philosophical than history for poetry expresses the universal , and history only the particular .
ENTJ	Hence poetry is something more philosophic and of graver import than history , since its statements are rather of the nature of universals , whereas those of history are singulars .
INTJ	In the course of history , men come to see that iron necessity is neither iron nor necessary .
ENTJ	History is a set of lies agreed upon .
INFP	To correct a natural indifference I was placed half-way between misery and the sun . Misery kept me from believing that all was well under the sun , and the sun taught me that history was n't everything .
ESTP	Never throughout history has a man who lived a life of ease left a name worth remembering .
INFP	Those who weep for the happy periods which they encounter in history acknowledge what they want not the alleviation but the silencing of misery .
ESTP	There has never yet been a man in our history who led a life of ease whose name is worth remembering .
ISTP	Woz is living his own life now . He has n't been around Apple for about five years . But what he did will go down in history .
ENTJ	Europe was created by history . America was created by philosophy .
ENTP	I want to reform the tax code so that it 's simple , fair , and asks the wealthiest households to pay higher taxes on incomes over $ 250,000 - the same rate we had when Bill Clinton was president the same rate we had when our economy created nearly 23 million new jobs , the biggest surplus in history , and a lot of millionaires to boot .
ISTJ	If past history was all there was to the game , the richest people would be librarians .
INTJ	History does nothing it does not possess immense riches , it does not fight battles . It is men , real , living , who do all this .
INTP	In the long history of humankind ( and animal kind , too ) those who learned to collaborate and improvise most effectively have prevailed .
ESTJ	We do n't want tradition . We want to live in the present and the only history that is worth a tinker 's dam is the history we make today .
ENTP	History is only the register of crimes and misfortunes .
INTJ	The whole history of science has been the gradual realization that events do not happen in an arbitrary manner , but that they reflect a certain underlying order , which may or may not be divinely inspired .
ENTP	We 've persevered because of a belief we share with the Iraqi people - a belief that out of the ashes of war , a new beginning could be born in this cradle of civilization . Through this remarkable chapter in the history of the United States and Iraq , we have met our responsibility . Now , it 's time to turn the page .
ENTP	I would put our legislative and foreign policy accomplishments in our first two years against any president - with the possible exceptions of Johnson , FDR , and Lincoln - just in terms of what we 've gotten done in modern history . But , you know , but when it comes to the economy , we 've got a lot more work to do . And we 're gon na keep on at it .
ENTP	Indeed , history is nothing more than a tableau of crimes and misfortunes .
ENTP	History should be written as philosophy .
ISFJ	President Barack Obama has stood watch over the greatest job loss in modern American history . And that , my friends , is one inconvenient truth that will haunt this President throughout history .
ESTP	The point in history at which we stand is full of promise and danger . The world will either move forward toward unity and widely shared prosperity - or it will move apart .
INTJ	It is not history which uses men as a means of achieving - as if it were an individual person - its own ends . History is nothing but the activity of men in pursuit of their ends .
ENFP	Men do not learn much from the lessons of history and that is the most important of all the lessons of history .
INFP	For most of history , Anonymous was a woman .
ENFP	De Sade is the one completely consistent and thoroughgoing revolutionary of history .
ESTJ	Whether a woman 's running for office or she 's supporting her husband who 's running for office and she gets criticised for wearing open-toed shoes or for the colour of her coat , there 's just a lot of history that you bear if you are a woman who puts herself out in the political arena .
ENTP	Religions , which condemn the pleasures of sense , drive men to seek the pleasures of power . Throughout history power has been the vice of the ascetic .
ENTJ	Skepticism is a virtue in history as well as in philosophy .
INTJ	The history of all previous societies has been the history of class struggles .

ESTJ	This is a moment in history where it is almost hard to catch your breath .
ISTJ	The history of free men is never really written by chance but by choice their choice !
INTJ	The writer may very well serve a movement of history as its mouthpiece , but he can not of course create it .
ISTJ	Things have never been more like the way they are today in history .
ENTJ	Our nation was created in ways that allow human potential to prosper , and it created the greatest nation for people in the history of humanity . Now Obama is dismantling it , because he has no appreciation for our greatness . In fact , he resents it . He blames this country for whatever evils he sees around the world .
ESFJ	Nixon is one of the few in the history of this country to run for high office talking out of both sides of his mouth at the same time and lying out of both sides .
ESFJ	I do n't think we handled the aftermath of the fall of Baghdad as well as we might have . But that 's now history .

ENTP	If you think you have it tough , read history books .
INTJ	Well , I think that California has had a history of always spending more money than it takes in .
INTP	I 'm not one of those who wants to purge our society of our Christian history .
ESFJ	There is nothing new in the world except the history you do not know .
ENFP	In known history , nobody has had such capacity for altering the universe than the people of the United States of America . And nobody has gone about it in such an aggressive way .
INTJ	Ideas shape the course of history .
INFP	The history of men 's opposition to women 's emancipation is more interesting perhaps than the story of that emancipation itself .
INTJ	The history of liberty is a history of resistance .
ESFP	I loved history because to me , history was like watching a movie .
ESTP	Americans are rising to the tasks of history , and they expect the same of us .
ESTP	Presidents quickly realize that while a single act might destroy the world they live in , no one single decision can make life suddenly better or can turn history around for the good .
ESTP	Now , there are some who would like to rewrite history - revisionist historians is what I like to call them .
ESFP	I think documentaries are the greatest way to educate an entire generation that does n't often look back to learn anything about the history that provided a safe haven for so many of us today .
ESTP	The true history of my administration will be written 50 years from now , and you and I will not be around to see it .
ESTP	I sent American troops to Iraq to make its people free , not to make them American . Iraqis will write their own history and find their own way .
ESFJ	In its history , Europe has committed so many massacres and horrors that it should bow its own head in shame .
INTJ	'WASP ' is the only ethnic term that is in fact a term of class , apart from redneck , which is another word for the same group but who are in the lower social strata , so it 's inexplicably tied up with social standing and culture and history in a way that the other hyphenations just are not .
INFJ	The principle that human nature , in its psychological aspects , is nothing more than a product of history and given social relations removes all barriers to coercion and manipulation by the powerful .
ESTJ	There are still many causes worth sacrificing for , so much history yet to be made .
ENTP	In every election in American history both parties have their cliches . The party that has the cliches that ring true wins .
INTJ	I think the materialist conception of history is valid .
ENFP	Throughout human history , the apostles of purity , those who have claimed to possess a total explanation , have wrought havoc among mere mixed-up human beings .
ENFJ	Black history is American history .

INTJ	There is little for the great part of the history of the world except the bitter tears of pity and the hot tears of wrath .
ISFJ	I feel like I 'm too busy writing history to read it .
INFP	The history of mankind is the instant between two strides taken by a traveler .
INTJ	It is like writing history with lightning and my only regret is that it is all so terribly true .
ENTJ	The history of the world shows that peoples and societies do not have to pass through a fixed series of stages in the course of development .
ENTJ	Jewelry and pins have been worn throughout history as symbols of power , sending messages . Interestingly enough , it was mostly men who wore the jewelry in various times , and obviously crowns were part of signals that were being sent throughout history by people of rank .
ISFJ	The Carter Center has the only existing international taskforce on disease eradication . Which means a total elimination of a disease on the face of the Earth . In the history of the world , there 's only been one disease eradicated : smallpox . The second disease , I think , is gon na be guinea worm .
ENTP	A man acquainted with history may , in some respect , be said to have lived from the beginning of the world , and to have been making continual additions to his stock of knowledge in every century .
INFP	There 's something quite exciting when you have a history with somebody and you see them do new and different things .
ESFP	I really like to look like a history book . I can look 1940s , I can look 1970s hippie-chic , or sometimes I 'll pull that '80s Brooklyn hip-hop kid with the door-knocker earrings .
ENTP	The advantages found in history seem to be of three kinds , as it amuses the fancy , as it improves the understanding , and as it strengthens virtue .
INFJ	I 'm not keen on history being tampered with ... to any extent .
ENTP	I want to write a book which is the history of comedy .
ENTJ	If you look at U.S. history through religious history , there is very much a motif that shows the importance religion has played in the U.S. We 're a very religious country and it affects the way we look at various political issues .
ESTJ	No country in the history of the world has ever contributed more to humankind and accomplished more for its people in so brief a period of time as Israel has done since its relatively recent rebirth in 1948 .
INTP	I thought that all of the sacrifices and blessings of the whole history of mankind have devolved upon me . Thank you , God .
ISTJ	But every historical statement and legitimization itself moves within a certain relation to history .
ENFP	The nation is faced with one of the most corporate-orientated anti-consumer Congresses in our history .
INTP	It is in the very nature of things human that every act that has once made its appearance and has been recorded in the history of mankind stays with mankind as a potentiality long after its actuality has become a thing of the past .
INTJ	A study of the history of opinion is a necessary preliminary to the emancipation of the mind .
ESTJ	I 'm really interested in modern history , but to fulfill a History degree at Brown you have to do modern and pre-modern .
ENFJ	You 're going to relegate my history to a month .
ENTP	I normally ignore the History Channel .
ENFJ	Over the objections , where they sound like squealing pigs , over the objections of Romney and all his allies , we passed some of the toughest Wall Street regulations in history , turning Wall Street back into the allocator of capital it always has been and no longer a casino . And they want to repeal it .
ENFJ	There 's a lot of revisionist history that goes on these days about Iraq .
ENFJ	I graduated from the University of Delaware with a double major in history and political science .
ISTJ	Whatever can be noted historically can be found within history .
ENFP	If you take a look at history , you will find that the understanding of what is good and evil has always existed before the individual religions . The religions were only invented by people afterwards , in order to express this idea .
ISTP	The subject matter is very tricky . It 's about the Munich massacre and what Mossad did afterwards with the assassination squads . I think it 's a turning point in history , especially for the Palestinians .
ISTP	It 's a huge challenge , a huge responsibility . Bond is a huge iconic figure in movie history . These opportunities do n't come along very often so I thought , 'Why not ? '
ENFP	In this world without quiet corners , there can be no easy escapes from history , from hullabaloo , from terrible , unquiet fuss .
ENFP	There is a widespread difficulty in the Muslim world , which has to do with how the people are taught about examining their own history . A whole range of stuff has been placed off limits .
ENTP	I do n't see women and think of them as competition or with judgment . Women really move me . I feel connected to all kinds of women . I am angry because I think we 've been mistreated throughout history in different countries , including America . I admire women .
INTP	Anybody who comes to the cinema is bringing they 're whole sexual history , their literary history , their movie literacy , their culture , their language , their religion , whatever they 've got . I ca n't possibly manipulate all of that , nor do I want to .
INTP	History keeps her secrets longer than most of us . But she has one secret that I will reveal to you tonight in the greatest confidence . Sometimes there are no winners at all . And sometimes nobody needs to lose .
ENTJ	When President Obama entered the White House , the economy was in a free-fall . The auto industry : on its back . The banks : frozen up . More than three million Americans had already lost their jobs . And America 's bravest , our men and women in uniform , were fighting what would soon be the longest wars in our history .
ENTJ	In terms of the history of a far reaching movement , 20 years is not that long .
ENTJ	History is always changing .
ESFP	I realise that I do not change the course of history . I am an actor , I do a movie , that 's the end of it . You have to realise we are just clowns for hire . After I had success it was great , at first , not to worry about money . It was on my mind when I was growing up .
ENFP	From lies to forgeries the step is not so long , and I have written technical essays on the logic of forgeries and on the influence of forgeries on history .
ENTJ	The president led us into the Iraq war on the basis of unproven assertions without evidence he embraced a radical doctrine of pre-emptive war unprecedented in our history and he failed to build a true international coalition .
ENTJ	The American people voted to restore integrity and honesty in Washington , D.C. , and the Democrats intend to lead the most honest , most open and most ethical Congress in history .
INFJ	The only justification for repressive institutions is material and cultural deficit . But such institutions , at certain stages of history , perpetuate and produce such a deficit , and even threaten human survival .
INTP	History has not dealt kindly with the aftermath of protracted periods of low risk premiums .
ISTJ	Strip malls are history .
ENTJ	Everybody knows they 're on the Obama team : There is n't vice presidential vs. presidential division , there 's not a generational pull . People have internalized that this is a real moment in history .
ENTJ	I do n't want to go negative on Franklin Delano Roosevelt , but he did n't pass an economic deal in the first 100 days . We have passed the largest Recovery Act in the history of the country .
ISFP	I know every note in every song , the whole history of it , even parts that were there and are gone .
ESTJ	We 've been a country that 's been fortunate to be protected by two oceans , to not have serious attacks on our territory for most of our history . And we were unfortunately reminded in a very devastating way of our vulnerability .
INFP	If we got into a situation where people start burning our records , then bring it on . That 's the whole point . The gloaming has begun . We 're in the darkness . This has happened before . Go read some history .
ENTJ	Any woman who understands the problems of running a home will be nearer to understanding the problems of running a country .
INTP	There is nothing like staying at home for real comfort .
INFP	I 'm the type who 'd be happy not going anywhere as long as I was sure I knew exactly what was happening at the places I was n't going to . I 'm the type who 'd like to sit home and watch every party that I 'm invited to on a monitor in my bedroom .
ESTP	In our home there was always prayer - aloud , proud and unapologetic .
ISFJ	Love begins at home , and it is not how much we do ... but how much love we put in that action .
ISFJ	Love begins by taking care of the closest ones - the ones at home .
INTJ	Let the wife make the husband glad to come home , and let him make her sorry to see him leave .
ISFP	If my world were to cave in tomorrow , I would look back on all the pleasures , excitements and worthwhilenesses I have been lucky enough to have had . Not the sadness , not my miscarriages or my father leaving home , but the joy of everything else . It will have been enough .
ISFP	Say there 's a white kid who lives in a nice home , goes to an all-white school , and is pretty much having everything handed to him on a platter - for him to pick up a rap tape is incredible to me , because what that 's saying is that he 's living a fantasy life of rebellion .
ESFP	It 's silly talking about how many years we will have to spend in the jungles of Vietnam when we could pave the whole country and put parking stripes on it and still be home by Christmas .
ESFP	We should declare war on North Vietnam . We could pave the whole country and put parking strips on it , and still be home by Christmas .
ISFP	There is just no comparison between having a dinner date with a man and staying home playing canasta with the girls .
ISFP	I did n't have nothin ' going for me ... school , home ... until I found something I loved , which was music , and that changed everything .
INTJ	An artist has no home in Europe except in Paris .
ENTP	The instruction we find in books is like fire . We fetch it from our neighbours , kindle it at home , communicate it to others , and it becomes the property of all .
ENTP	So long as I 'm Commander-in-Chief , we will sustain the strongest military the world has ever known . When you take off the uniform , we will serve you as well as you 've served us - because no one who fights for this country should have to fight for a job , or a roof over their head , or the care that they need when they come home .
ISTP	The most compelling reason for most people to buy a computer for the home will be to link it to a nationwide communications network . We 're just in the beginning stages of what will be a truly remarkable breakthrough for most people - as remarkable as the telephone .
ESTJ	My home is in Heaven . I 'm just traveling through this world .
ESTJ	Nothing can bring a real sense of security into the home except true love .
ISFP	My father probably thought the capital of the world was wherever he was at the time . It could n't possibly be anyplace else . Where he and his wife were in their own home , that , for them , was the capital of the world .
ISFP	The land created me . I 'm wild and lonesome . Even as I travel the cities , I 'm more at home in the vacant lots .
INTJ	If a dog will not come to you after having looked you in the face , you should go home and examine your conscience .
ISTP	Basically my wife was immature . I 'd be at home in the bath and she 'd come in and sink my boats .
ENTJ	I just owe almost everything to my father and it 's passionately interesting for me that the things that I learned in a small town , in a very modest home , are just the things that I believe have won the election .
ISFJ	Today 's misery is real unemployment , home foreclosures and bankruptcies . This is the Obama Misery Index and its at a record high . Its going to take more than new rhetoric to put Americans back to work - its going to take a new president .
ISTP	I think a submarine is a very worthwhile weapon . I believe we can defend ourselves with submarines and all our troops back at home . This whole idea that we have to be in 130 countries and 900 bases ... is an old-fashioned idea .
ISFJ	For those who have come here illegally , they might have a transition time to allow them to set their affairs in order . And then go back home and get in line with everybody else . And if they get in line and they apply to become a citizen and get a green card , they will be treated like everybody else .
INFP	We all have times when we go home at night and pull out our hair and feel misunderstood and lonely and like we 're falling . I think the brain is such that there is always going to be something missing .
ENTJ	It 's passionately interesting for me that the things that I learned in a small town , in a very modest home , are just the things that I believe have won the election .
ESTJ	I believe the home and marriage is the foundation of our society and must be protected .
ESTJ	I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas .
ISTJ	Analogies , it is true , decide nothing , but they can make one feel more at home .
ESTJ	Now , I know there are many Americans who say , 'Get out of Afghanistan . Bring 'em all home . ' And there are others who say , 'Put in hundreds of thousands of more . '
ISTJ	There are a number of things wrong with Washington . One of them is that everyone is too far from home .
INTP	The means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home .
ENFP	As much as I would love to be a person that goes to parties and has a couple of drinks and has a nice time , that does n't work for me . I 'd just rather sit at home and read , or go out to dinner with someone , or talk to someone I love , or talk to somebody that makes me laugh .
INFP	I have Social Disease . I have to go out every night . If I stay home one night I start spreading rumors to my dogs .
INFP	I had a lot of dates but I decided to stay home and dye my eyebrows .
INTP	The loss of liberty at home is to be charged to the provisions against danger , real or imagined , from abroad .
ESTP	We are not about to send American boys 9 or 10 thousand miles away from home to do what Asian boys ought to be doing for themselves .
INTP	It is a universal truth that the loss of liberty at home is to be charged to the provisions against danger , real or pretended , from abroad .
ESTJ	And I come here as a daughter , raised on the South Side of Chicago - by a father who was a blue-collar city worker and a mother who stayed at home with my brother and me .
ISFP	And when the day arrives I 'll become the sky and I 'll become the sea and the sea will come to kiss me for I am going home . Nothing can stop me now .
INTP	Perhaps it is a universal truth that the loss of liberty at home is to be charged to provisions against danger , real or pretended , from abroad .
ENTP	Things are n't right . If a burglar breaks into your home and you shoot him , he can sue you . For what , restraint of trade ?
ESTP	Always there has been some terrible evil at home or some monstrous foreign power that was going to gobble us up if we did not blindly rally behind it .
ESFP	I 've always thought my soundtracks do pretty good , because they 're basically professional equivalents of a mix tape I 'd make for you at home .
ENFP	I was coming home from kindergarten - well they told me it was kindergarten . I found out later I had been working in a factory for ten years . It 's good for a kid to know how to make gloves .
ISFJ	The perfect date for me would be staying at home , making a big picnic in bed , eating Wotsits and cookies while watching cable TV .
ENFP	We have two dogs , Mabel and Wolf , and three cats at home , Charlie , George and Chairman . We have two cats on our farm , Tom and Little Sister , two horses , and two mini horses , Hannah and Tricky . We also have two cows , Holy and Madonna . And those are only the animals we let sleep in our bed .
ESFJ	When I come home , my daughter will run to the door and give me a big hug , and everything that 's happened that day just melts away .
ESFP	My mother never gave up one me . I messed up in school so much they were sending me home , but my mother sent me right back .
ISTJ	Students never think it can be the teacher 's fault and so I thought I was stupid . I was frustrated and would come home and cry because I could n't do it . Then we got a new teacher who made math accessible . That made all the difference and I learned that it 's how you present it that makes it scary or friendly .
ENFP	England is my home . London is my home . New York feels like , if I have to spend a year living in an unfamiliar city , this is a pretty lovely one to spend a year in , but I will be going home at the end of it , certainly .
ISFP	Yes , I 've kissed a lot of guys . I like to kiss , but that 's it . I do n't go home with anyone . I sleep with my animals , like my baby monkey , Brigitte Bardot .
ISFP	Why would I retire ? Sit at home and watch TV ? No thanks . I 'd rather be out playing .
ISFP	Since the departure of good old-fashioned entertainers the re-emergence of somebody who wants to be an entertainer has unfortunately become a synonym for camp . I do n't think I 'm camper than any other person who felt at home on stage , and felt more at home on stage than he did offstage .
ESFP	I was making a lot of 8mm home movies , since I was twelve , making little dramas and comedies with the neighborhood kids .
ESTP	I report to you that our country is challenged at home and abroad : that it is our will that is being tried and not our strength our sense of purpose and not our ability to achieve a better America .
INTJ	The penalty for getting mugged in an American city and losing your ID is that you ca n't fly home .
ISTJ	In high school , a teacher once suggested that I be a math major in college . I thought , 'Me ? You 've got to be joking ! ' I mean , in junior high , I used to come home and cry because I was so afraid of my math homework . Seriously , I was terrified of math .
ISFP	Producing is so exciting because you can enable things to happen , whether it 's like discovering a filmmaker who you 're taking a chance on , protecting a battle and driving home at the end of the day just going , 'I 'm so glad I stayed late at work and fought hard for that . Had my passion . Won that battle . '
ESTP	I could n't care less about fashion . If I had taken any clothes home , they would have remained in my closet for the rest of their existence .
ENFP	Playing drums feels like coming home for me . Even during the White Stripes I thought : 'I 'll do this for now , but I 'm really a drummer . ' That 's what I 'll put on my passport application .
ENFP	I love coming home to somebody , I love being in a relationship .
ISTJ	When you do take the home pregnancy test , it does n't quite seem real . But when you see the baby and the heartbeat on the ultrasound , it 's so incredible .

ISFP	I was brought up in a household of chaos and I never felt stable at home .

ENTP	I like to think of myself at home in the armchair , writing , smoking and occasionally wandering down the shop .
INFJ	One of the great privileges of having grown up in a middle-class literary English household , but having gone to school in the front lines in Southeast London , was that I became half-street-urchin and half-good-boy at home . I knew that dichotomy was possible .

ESFJ	I like being at home and cooking .
ENFP	Do n't corral me , and I 'll always come home . Just let me go out and play during the day .
ENFJ	Just that working with Clint again is like coming home .
ENFJ	Sub-Saharan Africa is also home to 400 million of the world 's poorest people .
INTJ	I actually do think you 're seeing this trend towards organizations just caring more about their brand and engaging . And so I think Home Depot will want to humanize itself . I think that 's a lot of why companies are starting blogs , are just giving more insight into what 's going on with them .
ISFP	I want to go home at night and feel discomfort .
ESFP	I 'm actually graduating early . I got a lot of work done already . Being home schooled , I have had a lot of tutors help me .
ISFJ	I came here in 1974 to do a play , and then I went to L.A . I really like living in America . I feel more at home here than anywhere else .
ISFJ	In the theatre , people talk . Talk , talk until the cows come home about journeys of discovery and about what Hazlitt thought of a line of Shakespeare . I ca n't stand it .
INTP	Sleep more at night . If it 's allowed at work or home , take a nap in the afternoon . You 'll be amazed at how much better you 'll feel .
ISTJ	Most of the time I liked school and got good grades . In junior high , though , I hit a stumbling block with math - I used to come home and cry because of how frustrated I was ! But after a few good teachers and a lot of perseverance , I ended up loving math and even choosing it as a major when I got to college .
ISTJ	I exercise at home - light cardio and yoga .
ENFJ	Here at home , when Americans were standing in long lines to give blood after the attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon , we squandered an obvious opportunity to make service a noble cause again , and rekindle an American spirit of community .
ENFJ	I was kind of secretly hoping one of my kids would go out and make a million bucks . So when they put me in a home , at least I 'll have a window with a view .
INFP	Atlanta 's my musical home . It really was the place where I really came alive .
INFP	Every song I put on a record could be a single and I just pack my bags for it ... and the minute it takes off , I 'm not gon na be home for a while .
INFP	What I 've learned in my life , it 's a very interesting social study for me , to go back and forth between being the guy at home and being the guy on the road and being the guy in studio and being the guy in the interview . The environment around you has so much to do with your character , and when I 'm home , my character really changes quite a bit .
ENTP	For my wrap present , Colin Farrell gave me a first edition book . I got so involved with this character and I was so sad when the movie was over that when I got home and I tried to read the book I got really emotional and I started crying .
INTP	Yes , Americans can still get credit for cars and trucks and refrigerators , and those businesses are doing well . But just try to get a home loan now .
ISFJ	All I was doing was trying to get home from work .
INFP	I 'm still a kid . I 'm like six years old . But it 's just a matter of wanting to get up , it 's just a big journey . I felt like when I left home that I was on a journey , and I still am .
ESTP	I was gutted to leave my boyfriend at home when I started my tour , but taking my pillow was like taking a little bit of him with me .
ISFP	A fan sent me a letter and a $ 10 bill . It 's a short letter - all she said was , 'Hey , since it 's harder for you to go out these days without getting photographed , here $ 10 for a pizza . ' I was like , 'Aww , she sent me money for a pizza so I could eat at home ! '
INFJ	There is not a lot of separation between work and home life .
ESFP	It 's simple : You get a part . You play a part . You play it well . You do your work and you go home . And what is wonderful about movies is that once they 're done , they belong to the people . Once you make it , it 's what they see . That 's where my head is at .
INTJ	It 's a miracle was the last track recorded for the album , we based it on the rhythm from the middle of 'Late Home Tonight , where there 's Graham Broad playing lots and lots of drums with me shouting in the background , pretending to be a mad Arab leader .
ISFJ	The best thing for me is , when I 'm not working , is to be at home and to have a script or two scripts is better , and to be just walking around the house and just thinking about the lines .
ESTP	Having been let out of the barn once , I know I would n't be happy if I were home all the time .
ESFJ	You make movies for the people . If critics happen to like them too , well , that 's a home run .
ENFJ	I have a five year-old son and a three year-old daughter . I want my son to have a choice to contribute fully in the workforce or at home . And I want my daughter to have the choice to not just succeed , but to be liked for her accomplishments .
ISFP	Do n't get me wrong - I 've gone to a club . But I 'd much rather be with my close friends at home or a concert , or on a trip . I 'll go dancing with my grandma . She likes to cut a rug !
INFP	I hit the ground running , without a lot of training , so I had to do whatever I could do to survive as a professional , and if that meant being that character 24/7 and acting out , I was going to do that . I lived those characters , I brought them home with me .
INFP	I bought a Yamaha-1 and I was doing 180 miles per hour home on the 405 and that 's really , really crazy but I did it .
ESFP	Believe me , you can get into a lot of trouble being sixteen years old in a foreign country with no adult telling you when to come home .
INFJ	When my mother got home from work , she would take me to the movies . It was her way of getting out , and she would take me with her . I 'd go home and act all the parts . It had a tremendous influence on my becoming an actor .
INFJ	When I was doing 'Scarface , ' I remember being in love at that time . One of the few times in my life . And I was so glad it was at that time . I would come home and she would tell me about her life that day and all her problems and I remember saying to her , look , you really got me through this picture because I would shed everything when I came home .
ENFP	You 're always tellin ' me to go out more , Go ahead , get out and see the world , But then I think , why should I ? I 'd rather stay home and cry .
ISTJ	The killer app that got the world ready for appliances was the light bulb . So the light bulb is what wired the world . And they were n't thinking about appliances when they wired the world . They were really thinking about - they were n't putting electricity into the home . They were putting lighting into the home .
ISTJ	The one thing that offends me the most is when I walk by a bank and see ads trying to convince people to take out second mortgages on their home so they can go on vacation . That 's approaching evil .
ENTJ	The relevance for 9/11 is that what 9/11 marked was the beginning of a struggle in which the terrorists come at us and strike us here on our home territory . And it 's a global operation . It does n't know national boundaries or national borders .
ESFJ	I remember when I came home from the hospital after having my son , I wore a Narciso Rodriguez black coat . Then , I was using this fragrance that I had created . I walk by that coat , and it still smells like that fragrance . It takes you right there .
ESFP	And I came back and it was great , 'cuz George had set up all these flowers all over the studio saying welcome home . So then we got it together again . I always felt it was better on the White one for me . We were more like a band , you know .
ENTJ	From the moment this baby came into our home , those two dogs have never been more in love . It 's the most beautiful thing I 've ever witnessed . People keep saying , 'Oh , you 're a single mom . ' I 'm like , 'Actually , I 'm not . I 've got two boys helping . '
ENTJ	I saw the president make the tough calls in the Situation Room - and today , our troops in Iraq have finally come home so America can do some nation building here at home . That was the change that we believed in . That was the change we fought for . That was the change President Obama delivered .
INFP	The aesthetic came along the way , I think - just through experimenting , and going on tour , and trying stuff out on stage , having fun with it , and not taking it too seriously . If I had a ballgown at home , I 'd wear it onstage . If I found something in a charity shop , I 'd wear it . That 's where it grew from - just wanting to play dress-up .
ENTP	Mr. Bean is at his best when he is not using words , but I am equally at home in both verbal and nonverbal expression .
ENTP	Confronting a stadium audience , you ca n't see the whites of their eyes . It 's just an amorphous mass of noise and , of course , you ca n't see the alleged billions watching at home either , so the degree to which you are intimidated is quite low .
ESTP	I grew up in a home environment where I was n't getting esteem for anything I did .
ESFJ	I 'm still really close with everyone at home and their parents - and their brothers and sisters . I was so , so , so lucky to grow up as part of a community and I do n't take that for granted . I try very hard to stay part of it .
ESFJ	And now , I still really do n't care that much but now I have music playing all the time at home , which is a first for me . Whatever . Everything from Ani DiFranco to Dave Matthews to Jack Johnson and Norah Jones .
ESFJ	There 's an internal battle . I need to work , I need to work , I need to work and I need to be home with my kids and the kids win .
ESFJ	My sisters both are working mothers . I understand that my being an actress as well as being at home is n't some heroic thing . That does n't mean it is n't confusing or difficult - especially that question of how you find a balance .
ESFJ	No , let 's make sure that people understand that this is a very important war that is helping to protect us here at home . And that we have no choice but to win it . As difficult as it is .

ISFP	I have two homes in Malibu , a home in Canada that I 'm building , and I just love pouring my heart out into this part of my life .

INFJ	But , yeah , I 'm really happy when I 'm writing . When I 'm being creative and when I have something that I can put down . You know , if you go out and you overhear a conversation or you have a thought , you have a receptacle to go home and say , 'Oh , this would be great in this script . ' Your antenna 's out in a different way , and I love that time .
INTJ	I fantasize about having a manual job where I can come home at night , read a book and not feel responsible for what will happen the next day .

INFJ	I do portraits . I usually do live models in a class environment , but I 've been painting at home more . I really love the human form , and I love faces . I 've tried to do landscapes a few times .

INFJ	One loves to possess arms , though they hope never to have occasion for them .
ISTJ	The rich are always going to say that , you know , just give us more money and we 'll go out and spend more and then it will all trickle down to the rest of you . But that has not worked the last 10 years , and I hope the American public is catching on .
INFJ	My theory has always been , that if we are to dream , the flatteries of hope are as cheap , and pleasanter , than the gloom of despair .
ESFP	I hope that no American will waste his franchise and throw away his vote by voting either for me or against me solely on account of my religious affiliation . It is not relevant .

ENTJ	A leader is a dealer in hope .
ENFP	I only hope that we do n't lose sight of one thing - that it was all started by a mouse .
ENFJ	Hope is definitely not the same thing as optimism . It is not the conviction that something will turn out well , but the certainty that something makes sense , regardless of how it turns out .
INFP	Man wants to live , but it is useless to hope that this desire will dictate all his actions .
INFP	He who despairs of the human condition is a coward , but he who has hope for it is a fool .
ISTP	I 'll always stay connected with Apple . I hope that throughout my life I 'll sort of have the thread of my life and the thread of Apple weave in and out of each other , like a tapestry . There may be a few years when I 'm not there , but I 'll always come back .
INTJ	When I die , I hope to go to Heaven , whatever the Hell that is .
ESTP	I 've tried to reduce profanity but I reduced so much profanity when writing the book that I 'm afraid not much could come out . Perhaps we will have to consider it simply as a profane book and hope that the next book will be less profane or perhaps more sacred .
INTJ	You are not here merely to make a living . You are here in order to enable the world to live more amply , with greater vision , with a finer spirit of hope and achievement . You are here to enrich the world , and you impoverish yourself if you forget the errand .
ISFJ	Together we will build an America where hope is a new job with a paycheck , not a faded word on an old bumper sticker .
ISFP	I would describe myself as emotional and highly strung . If something upsets me , it really upsets me . If something makes me angry , I get really angry . But it 's all very upfront . I ca n't hide it . I 'm also loyal and I hope I 'm fun .

ESFJ	Hope is the greatest thing for moms of autism . Hope is what gets us out of bed in the morning . I 'm on a mission to tell parents that there is a way .

INFJ	How wonderful that we have met with a paradox . Now we have some hope of making progress .

INTJ	The cause of my life has been to oppose superstition . It 's a battle you ca n't hope to win - it 's a battle that 's going to go on forever . It 's part of the human condition .
INTP	What can I know ? What ought I to do ? What can I hope ?
ISFP	I hope that what you take away from my album is not just the music - which I did want to be fun , and I did want it to be about individuality , but please also take away from it that there 's no dream that 's too big .
ENTJ	I am a beneficiary of the American people 's generosity , and I hope we can have comprehensive immigration legislation that allows this country to continue to be enriched by those who were not born here .

ENTJ	I hope I 'm wrong , but I am afraid that Iraq is going to turn out to be the greatest disaster in American foreign policy - worse than Vietnam , not in the number who died , but in terms of its unintended consequences and its reverberation throughout the region .

ESFJ	People always ask me if I 'm going to stop modeling because I have started an acting career . I hope to continue to model for years to come .
ESFJ	Acting is something I love . It 's a great craft that I have a lot of respect for . But I do n't think it 's any greater challenge than teaching 8-year-olds or any other career . In my life , I try not to make it more important than it is and I just hope that rubs off on the people around me .
ESFP	The media tried to destroy my parents and has taken things completely out of context , but there 's not a whole lot you can do in terms of fighting back . You have to hope that it passes , which it always does . But they have to be careful . They did n't necessarily sign up for this .

INTJ	I hope that Facebook and other Internet technologies were able to help people , just like we hope that we help them communicate and organize and do whatever they want to every single day , but I do n't pretend that if Facebook did n't exist , that this would n't even be possible . Of course , it would have .

ENFP	When you put something out there into the world , there 's all these words you do n't want to hear , that you hope people do n't say . I do n't like anything that starts with 're ' - like retro , reinvent , recreate - I hate that . It 's always like living in the past - copying , emulating .

INTP	Most people like to read about intrigue and spies . I hope to provide a metaphor for the average reader 's daily life . Most of us live in a slightly conspiratorial relationship with our employer and perhaps with our marriage .
ENTJ	For a person who promised hope and civility in politics , Mr. Obama has shown a borderline obsessiveness in blaming Mr. Bush .
ESTJ	My hope is that I will take the good from my experiences and extrapolate them further into areas with which I am unfamiliar . I simply do not know exactly what that difference will be in my judging . But I accept there will be some based on my gender and my Latina heritage .
ESFP	You never know what movie I will be in next , but let 's just hope it 's sells ( for my sake at least ) !
ENTJ	I think by now I have made it fairly clear that I am not very happy with the word hope . I do n't believe in people just hoping .
INFP	The other day I got a text from a boy , but it was n't hot . I mean , if you 're going to text me every day , you have n't seen me for months and you 're trying to seduce me , you 'd better spice up that text and make it more exciting than 'How was your day ? I hope you 're having a beautiful one . ' Sadly , I have n't been doing a lot of kissing lately .
ESFP	I have learned from my experiences in this industry that there is absolutely no way to control people 's opinions on your performance in your movie . You go out there , promote your film and hope people like the work you did .

ESFJ	I hope by the time I 'm 30 to have a husband and maybe a baby .

ESFJ	House and Senate Republicans are now united in adopting earmark bans . We hope President Obama will follow through on his support for an earmark ban by pressing Democratic leaders to join House and Senate Republicans in taking this critical step to restore public trust .
INFP	I love the Beatles . I have n't named any kids after them but I still really love them . They were the first group that I was ever properly aware of .

INFJ	Like all parents , my husband and I just do the best we can , hold our breath and hope we 've set aside enough money for our kid 's therapy .
ESFJ	I 'm moving on . I should have made that clear when I made the announcement . I guess I was n't clear . If people think you 're leaving a show after all these years , you might be retiring . So I understand where they 're coming from , but I should have impressed the fact that I hope I 'm just moving on right now .
INFP	I would hope everyone would be a feminist .
ISTP	As a young actor , people were trying to define who I was before I really knew that for myself . But I still remember thinking , 'This is what I love doing , and I hope I 'm going to be able to do it forever . '
ISFJ	Yes , well I really hope I can make a difference , even in the smallest way . I am looking forward to helping as much as I can .
ISFP	You travel with the hope that something unexpected will happen . It has to do with enjoying being lost and figuring it out and the satisfaction .

INFJ	Humor is not a mood but a way of looking at the world . So if it is correct to say that humor was stamped out in Nazi Germany , that does not mean that people were not in good spirits , or anything of that sort , but something much deeper and more important .

ISFJ	There was a time I was very much blaming the way I felt on L.A , that it was a vacuum of creativity , of humor or anything organic , and I was really angry at the place . But then today I feel completely different - I love L.A. !
ISFJ	I 'm interested not just in projects that I 'll be starring in , but producing film and TV that 's really quality and great for adults and when I say 'great for adults , ' it does n't mean without humor , because I 'm also interested in doing comedy .

ENFP	There are many ways to be free . One of them is to transcend reality by imagination , as I try to do .
ESFP	The only limit to your impact is your imagination and commitment .

INFJ	Uttering a word is like striking a note on the keyboard of the imagination .

ISTP	Essentially , I 'm untrained , so I just go with my imagination and try to put myself as solidly as I can into the shoes of whatever person I 'm going to be playing .
INTP	Novelists are not equipped to make a movie , in my opinion . They make their own movie when they write : they 're casting , they 're dressing the scene , they 're working out where the energy of the scene is coming from and they 're also relying tremendously on the creative imagination of the reader .
INFP	I 'm a light sleeper . I 've never been one of those people who can put their head down and suddenly everything disappears . Nighttime is the time I get most scared , anxious or worried . In those darker moments before waking or sleeping is when I feel most , I do n't know , I can turn on myself , and my imagination can take me dark places .
INFP	I 've got quite a vivid imagination and I 'm easily overwhelmed by sensations and things that are beautiful or scary . I do n't think I 've ever seen a ghost - I think I 'm probably haunted by my own ghosts than real ones .
ESTJ	I 'm not a passive person by any stretch of the imagination .
ENFP	I feel very giddy with the idea of making my imagination take form and being able to put on a show where people leave feeling like they 've experienced something .
ISFP	My favorite literature to read is fairly dry history . I like the framework , and my imagination can do the rest .
ENFP	Charles Laughton , who 's a great hero of mine , only ever made one film and it happens to be one of the great films ever , which is 'The Night of the Hunter . ' It 's full of his kind of imagination and creation and how you do things and just in the way he used the studio , I just thought it was a fantastical way of using the studio .
INFJ	I was a wild , mischievous kid , and I had tremendous imagination . Any experience I had , I 'd try to reenact it .
ENFP	Find a place inside where there 's joy , and the joy will burn out the pain .
INTJ	Even if I knew that tomorrow the world would go to pieces , I would still plant my apple tree .
ISFP	Nothing is impossible , the word itself says 'I 'm possible ' !
ESTP	Believe you can and you 're halfway there .
ESFP	We ca n't help everyone , but everyone can help someone .
INFJ	The glow of one warm thought is to me worth more than money .
INFJ	In a gentle way , you can shake the world .
ENFP	Whoever is happy will make others happy too .
ENTP	A place for everything , everything in its place .
ESTP	With self-discipline most anything is possible .
ESFP	It is in your moments of decision that your destiny is shaped .
ISFP	Let us dream of tomorrow where we can truly love from the soul , and know love as the ultimate truth at the heart of all creation .
INFP	Men must live and create . Live to the point of tears .
ENFJ	Learning how to be still , to really be still and let life happen - that stillness becomes a radiance .
ISTP	To me , the Seventies were very inspirational and very influential ... With my whole persona as Snoop Dogg , as a person , as a rapper . I just love the Seventies style , the way all the players dressed nice , you know , kept their hair looking good , drove sharp cars and they talked real slick .
ENTP	I used to make up stuff in my bio all the time , that I used to be a professional ice-skater and stuff like that . I found it so inspirational . Why not make myself cooler than I am ?
INTP	The difference between stupidity and genius is that genius has its limits .
INTP	It 's not that I 'm so smart , it 's just that I stay with problems longer .
INTP	Any man who reads too much and uses his own brain too little falls into lazy habits of thinking .
INTP	Intellectuals solve problems , geniuses prevent them .
ESTP	An intelligent man is sometimes forced to be drunk to spend time with his fools .
ENTP	Common sense is not so common .
ENFP	I must have a prodigious quantity of mind it takes me as much as a week sometimes to make it up .
ENFP	To expect the unexpected shows a thoroughly modern intellect .
INTP	Information is not knowledge .
ENTJ	Wit is educated insolence .
INFP	An intellectual is someone whose mind watches itself .
ESTP	I 'm not the smartest fellow in the world , but I can sure pick smart colleagues .
INFP	The surest sign that intelligent life exists elsewhere in the universe is that it has never tried to contact us .
ISTP	I 'm an optimist in the sense that I believe humans are noble and honorable , and some of them are really smart . I have a very optimistic view of individuals .
INFP	We have now sunk to a depth at which restatement of the obvious is the first duty of intelligent men .
ESTJ	Your intellect may be confused , but your emotions will never lie to you .
INFP	Promise me you 'll always remember : You 're braver than you believe , and stronger than you seem , and smarter than you think .
ISTJ	What a distressing contrast there is between the radiant intelligence of the child and the feeble mentality of the average adult .
ISTJ	An intellectual is a man who takes more words than necessary to tell more than he knows .
ISTJ	The voice of the intellect is a soft one , but it does not rest until it has gained a hearing .
INFP	There are some ideas so wrong that only a very intelligent person could believe in them .
INTJ	Ah ! yes , I know : those who see me rarely trust my word : I must look too intelligent to keep it .
ESFP	To think is to practice brain chemistry .
INTJ	I not only use all the brains that I have , but all that I can borrow .
ENFJ	The emotional brain responds to an event more quickly than the thinking brain .
ENTP	Wherever smart people work , doors are unlocked .
ESTP	Continuous effort - not strength or intelligence - is the key to unlocking our potential .
INFP	Science has not yet taught us if madness is or is not the sublimity of the intelligence .
ESFP	I do n't think the intelligence reports are all that hot . Some days I get more out of the New York Times .
ENTP	The first method for estimating the intelligence of a ruler is to look at the men he has around him .
ISTP	Bottom line is , I did n't return to Apple to make a fortune . I 've been very lucky in my life and already have one . When I was 25 , my net worth was $ 100 million or so . I decided then that I was n't going to let it ruin my life . There 's no way you could ever spend it all , and I do n't view wealth as something that validates my intelligence .
ESFP	Everything in the universe has a purpose . Indeed , the invisible intelligence that flows through everything in a purposeful fashion is also flowing through you .
INFP	The modern mind is in complete disarray . Knowledge has stretched itself to the point where neither the world nor our intelligence can find any foot-hold . It is a fact that we are suffering from nihilism .
ESTP	I do n't even call it violence when it 's in self defense I call it intelligence .
INTP	Immaturity is the incapacity to use one 's intelligence without the guidance of another .
ENTP	Where the stakes are the highest , in the war on terror , we can not possibly succeed without extraordinary international cooperation . Effective international police actions require the highest degree of intelligence sharing , planning and collaborative enforcement .
ISTJ	If men can develop weapons that are so terrifying as to make the thought of global war include almost a sentence for suicide , you would think that man 's intelligence and his comprehension ... would include also his ability to find a peaceful solution .
ENFP	Children are remarkable for their intelligence and ardor , for their curiosity , their intolerance of shams , the clarity and ruthlessness of their vision .
ENTP	Religion is something left over from the infancy of our intelligence , it will fade away as we adopt reason and science as our guidelines .
ISFJ	We will strengthen our security by building missile defense , restoring our military might , and standing by and strengthening our intelligence officers .
ENFP	Man is an intelligence in servitude to his organs .
ENTP	So far as I can remember , there is not one word in the Gospels in praise of intelligence .
INTJ	It is not clear that intelligence has any long-term survival value .
ESTJ	In the aftermath of September 11 , and as the 9/11 Commission report so aptly demonstrates , it is clear that our intelligence system is not working the way that it should .
ISFP	I 'm in awe of the universe , but I do n't necessarily believe there 's an intelligence or agent behind it . I do have a passion for the visual in religious rituals , though , even though they may be completely empty and bereft of substance . The incense is powerful and provocative , whether Buddhist or Catholic .
INFP	There can be no two opinions as to what a highbrow is . He is the man or woman of thoroughbred intelligence who rides his mind at a gallop across country in pursuit of an idea .
ENTJ	George W. Bush attended the intelligence briefing every day . Obama has not even attended half of them . He sends surrogates . That to me is significant .
INFJ	Philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language .
ENTP	The Clinton White House today said they would start to give national security and intelligence briefings to George Bush . I do n't know how well this is working out . Today after the first one Bush said , 'I 've got one question : What color is the red phone ? '
ENFP	Intelligence agencies keep things secret because they often violate the rule of law or of good behavior .
INTP	It 's part of a writer 's profession , as it 's part of a spy 's profession , to prey on the community to which he 's attached , to take away information - often in secret - and to translate that into intelligence for his masters , whether it 's his readership or his spy masters . And I think that both professions are perhaps rather lonely .
ESFP	Bill Gates wants people to think he 's Edison , when he 's really Rockefeller . Referring to Gates as the smartest man in America is n't right ... wealth is n't the same thing as intelligence .
ENFJ	But once you are in that field , emotional intelligence emerges as a much stronger predictor of who will be most successful , because it is how we handle ourselves in our relationships that determines how well we do once we are in a given job .
INFP	If I could have been a marine biologist I would have , but I did n't have that kind of intelligence . Numbers were never my strong point .
INTP	The Secret Intelligence Service I knew occupied dusky suites of little rooms opposite St James 's Park Tube station in London .
ESTJ	We know that there are unaccounted-for Scud and other ballistic missiles in Iraq . And part of the problem is that , since 1998 , there has been no way to even get minimal information about those programs except through intelligence means .
ENTJ	The White House is giving George W. Bush intelligence briefings . You know , some of these jokes just write themselves .
ENFJ	When I went on to write my next book , Working With Emotional Intelligence , I wanted to make a business case that the best performers were those people strong in these skills .
ENFJ	Emotional intelligence begins to develop in the earliest years . All the small exchanges children have with their parents , teachers , and with each other carry emotional messages .
INFJ	I think intelligence is totally subjective it 's like sexiness .
ESFJ	A great many people think that polysyllables are a sign of intelligence .
INFJ	I do n't know how to depict intelligence .
ENTJ	People do n't want to believe that technology is broken . Pharmaceuticals , robotics , artificial intelligence , nanotechnology - all these areas where the progress has been a lot more limited than people think . And the question is why .
ISTJ	It will be found an unjust and unwise jealousy to deprive a man of his natural liberty upon the supposition he may abuse it .
ENFP	Never underestimate the power of jealousy and the power of envy to destroy . Never underestimate that .
INFJ	I am drawn to women who are independent and creative , which is problematic because it 's a struggle , a competition of careers . There 's jealousy .
INFJ	Those who are believed to be most abject and humble are usually most ambitious and envious .
INFP	Serious sport has nothing to do with fair play . It is bound up with hatred , jealousy , boastfulness , disregard of all rules and sadistic pleasure in witnessing violence . In other words , it is war minus the shooting .
INTP	Knowledge of what is does not open the door directly to what should be .
INFJ	He who knows nothing is closer to the truth than he whose mind is filled with falsehoods and errors .
INFJ	I was bold in the pursuit of knowledge , never fearing to follow truth and reason to whatever results they led , and bearding every authority which stood in their way .
INTJ	It is not when truth is dirty , but when it is shallow , that the lover of knowledge is reluctant to step into its waters .
ENTP	There is much pleasure to be gained from useless knowledge .
ENFP	The possession of knowledge does not kill the sense of wonder and mystery . There is always more mystery .
INTJ	Let us tenderly and kindly cherish , therefore , the means of knowledge . Let us dare to read , think , speak , and write .
INTP	All our knowledge begins with the senses , proceeds then to the understanding , and ends with reason . There is nothing higher than reason .
INTJ	If knowledge can create problems , it is not through ignorance that we can solve them .
INTJ	Suppose that we are wise enough to learn and know - and yet not wise enough to control our learning and knowledge , so that we use it to destroy ourselves ? Even if that is so , knowledge remains better than ignorance .
INFP	The true method of knowledge is experiment .
INTP	Reading furnishes the mind only with materials of knowledge it is thinking that makes what we read ours .
INTP	I had therefore to remove knowledge , in order to make room for belief .
ENTP	Our knowledge can only be finite , while our ignorance must necessarily be infinite .
INFJ	Consider your origins : you were not made to live as brutes , but to follow virtue and knowledge .
ESTP	Depend upon it there comes a time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before . It is of the highest importance , therefore , not to have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones .
INTJ	I 'm hungry for knowledge . The whole thing is to learn every day , to get brighter and brighter . That 's what this world is about . You look at someone like Gandhi , and he glowed . Martin Luther King glowed . Muhammad Ali glows . I think that 's from being bright all the time , and trying to be brighter .
INTP	Whoever undertakes to set himself up as a judge of Truth and Knowledge is shipwrecked by the laughter of the gods .
ENFJ	Science investigates religion interprets . Science gives man knowledge which is power religion gives man wisdom which is control .
INTP	The gift of fantasy has meant more to me than my talent for absorbing positive knowledge .
INTP	There comes a time when the mind takes a higher plane of knowledge but can never prove how it got there .
ISTP	Knowledge will give you power , but character respect .
ISFP	Carry out a random act of kindness , with no expectation of reward , safe in the knowledge that one day someone might do the same for you .
INTJ	The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies but also to hate his friends .
ISFP	Knowledge speaks , but wisdom listens .
ESFP	The greater our knowledge increases the more our ignorance unfolds .
ENTP	The doorstep to the temple of wisdom is a knowledge of our own ignorance .
ENTJ	All men by nature desire knowledge .
ENTJ	The one exclusive sign of thorough knowledge is the power of teaching .
INTJ	The saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom .
INTJ	Our treasure lies in the beehive of our knowledge . We are perpetually on the way thither , being by nature winged insects and honey gatherers of the mind .
INTP	Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge : it is those who know little , and not those who know much , who so positively assert that this or that problem will never be solved by science .
ENTP	Three passions , simple but overwhelmingly strong , have governed my life : the longing for love , the search for knowledge , and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind .
ENTP	It is an infantile superstition of the human spirit that virginity would be thought a virtue and not the barrier that separates ignorance from knowledge .
ESFP	I 'm a student of world religion , so to me , it 's hugely important to have knowledge and to understand what people are doing .
ENTJ	Science is a way of thinking much more than it is a body of knowledge .
ENTP	Dogmatism and skepticism are both , in a sense , absolute philosophies one is certain of knowing , the other of not knowing . What philosophy should dissipate is certainty , whether of knowledge or ignorance .
ENFP	We did it Disneyland , in the knowledge that most of the people I talked to thought it would be a financial disaster - closed and forgotten within the first year .
ENFP	Thought must be divided against itself before it can come to any knowledge of itself .
INTP	Universities exist to transmit knowledge and understanding of ideas and values to students not to provide entertainment for spectators or employment for athletes .
INFP	A civilization is a heritage of beliefs , customs , and knowledge slowly accumulated in the course of centuries , elements difficult at times to justify by logic , but justifying themselves as paths when they lead somewhere , since they open up for man his inner distance .
INTP	Science is organized knowledge . Wisdom is organized life .
ENTP	The degree of one 's emotions varies inversely with one 's knowledge of the facts .
INTJ	Scientists have become the bearers of the torch of discovery in our quest for knowledge .
INFP	Although modesty is natural to man , it is not natural to children . Modesty only begins with the knowledge of evil .
INTP	Intuition and concepts constitute ... the elements of all our knowledge , so that neither concepts without an intuition in some way corresponding to them , nor intuition without concepts , can yield knowledge .
INTP	The advancement and diffusion of knowledge is the only guardian of true liberty .
INTP	The improvement of understanding is for two ends : first , our own increase of knowledge secondly , to enable us to deliver that knowledge to others .
INTP	The only fence against the world is a thorough knowledge of it .
ESTP	When a doctor does go wrong he is the first of criminals . He has nerve and he has knowledge .
ESTP	His ignorance was as remarkable as his knowledge .
INTP	Where all is but dream , reasoning and arguments are of no use , truth and knowledge nothing .
ESFP	My mom took me to see Carnal Knowledge and The Wild Bunch and all these kind of movies when I was a kid .
INFP	Take from the philosopher the pleasure of being heard and his desire for knowledge ceases .
INFP	We are sinful not only because we have eaten of the Tree of Knowledge , but also because we have not yet eaten of the Tree of Life . The state in which we are is sinful , irrespective of guilt .
INFP	How pathetically scanty my self-knowledge is compared with , say , my knowledge of my room . There is no such thing as observation of the inner world , as there is of the outer world .
ISFJ	When we go to the Bible we should keep in mind that the basic principles of the Bible are taught by God , but written down by human beings deprived of modern day knowledge . So there is some fallibility in the writings of the Bible . But the basic principles are applicable to my life and I do n't find any conflict among them .
ENTP	So I 'd be quite happy to have a three-hour Lincoln-Douglas-style debate with Barack Obama . I 'd let him use a teleprompter . I 'll just rely on knowledge . We 'll do fine .
ENTP	Scholastic learning and polemical divinity retarded the growth of all true knowledge .
ENFP	If I was left to my own devices , you would see about ten T-shirts in rotation with maybe a few nice pairs of jeans - but I also like to look good . I like feeling really well put together , I just do n't have the aptitude and the knowledge to do that .
INFJ	Knowledge is in the end based on acknowledgement .
INTP	The ordinary American - as far as I can tell - knows so much less than he did fifty years ago and has such poor work habits compared with fifty years ago that the average multiplicand of knowledge/capabilities is a much smaller number than it was in 1961 .
ISTJ	Science is the knowledge of consequences , and dependence of one fact upon another .
INFJ	Learn from me , if not by my precepts , then by my example , how dangerous is the pursuit of knowledge and how much happier is that man who believes his native town to be the world than he who aspires to be greater than his nature will allow .
ISFJ	I respect knowledge of the psyche . I would be a therapist if I were n't an entertainer .
ESTJ	The greatest sin is judgment without knowledge .
INTP	I have always liked the idea of going to print because a big part of what we are about is to disseminate knowledge throughout the world and not just to people who have broadband .
INTP	What can we put into the hands of people under oppressive regimes to help them ? For me , a big part of it is information , knowledge - the ability to defeat propaganda by understanding it .
ESTJ	People live longer today than they ever have . They live happier lives , have more knowledge , more information . All this is the result of communications technology . How is any of that bad ?
ESFP	It 's just us trying to start a movement where everybody passes on a bit of cooking knowledge . We estimate that one person can potentially affect 180 others very quickly so we 're just trying to spread the word .
ESFP	My advice to women in general : Even if you 're doing a nine-to-five job , treat yourself like a boss . Not arrogant , but be sure of what you want - and do n't allow people to run anything for you without your knowledge .
INTP	Imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge . That 's what we 're doing .
INTP	I think it 's a mistake to treat different realms of knowledge as if they are some how fundamentally the same .
ISFP	The minuses of celebrity include having to live with security and the knowledge that you may be stalked .
ESTJ	I was one of the first generations to watch television . TV exposes people to news , to information , to knowledge , to entertainment . How is it bad ?
INTP	Do you remember when you found out you would n't live forever ? People do n't talk about this , but everybody had to go through it because you 're not born with that knowledge .
ESTJ	If you think you can do a thing or think you ca n't do a thing , you 're right .
ENFJ	A genuine leader is not a searcher for consensus but a molder of consensus .
ENFJ	It is better to lead from behind and to put others in front , especially when you celebrate victory when nice things occur . You take the front line when there is danger . Then people will appreciate your leadership .
INFJ	I suppose leadership at one time meant muscles but today it means getting along with people .
ISTP	Be a yardstick of quality . Some people are n't used to an environment where excellence is expected .
ESTJ	Do n't find fault , find a remedy .
ISTP	Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower .
ISFJ	Leadership - leadership is about taking responsibility , not making excuses .
ESTP	People ask the difference between a leader and a boss . The leader leads , and the boss drives .
ESTP	You have to think anyway , so why not think big ?
ESFJ	High expectations are the key to everything .
ESFJ	The first man gets the oyster , the second man gets the shell .
ENFJ	The exercise of power is determined by thousands of interactions between the world of the powerful and that of the powerless , all the more so because these worlds are never divided by a sharp line : everyone has a small part of himself in both .
ENTP	I 'm not a natural leader . I 'm too intellectual I 'm too abstract I think too much .
ESFP	Leadership and learning are indispensable to each other .
ISTJ	The supreme quality for leadership is unquestionably integrity . Without it , no real success is possible , no matter whether it is on a section gang , a football field , in an army , or in an office .
ENTP	We ca n't drive our SUVs and eat as much as we want and keep our homes on 72 degrees at all times ... and then just expect that other countries are going to say OK. That 's not leadership . That 's not going to happen .
ISTJ	You do n't lead by hitting people over the head - that 's assault , not leadership .
ISFJ	My leadership will end the Obama era and begin a new era of American prosperity .
ISFJ	Central to America 's rise to global leadership is our Judeo-Christian tradition with the vision of the goodness and possibilities of every human life .
ESTP	Leadership to me means duty , honor , country . It means character , and it means listening from time to time .
ESTP	I have a different vision of leadership . A leadership is someone who brings people together .
ENFP	The function of leadership is to produce more leaders , not more followers .
ENFP	I start with the premise that the function of leadership is to produce more leaders , not more followers .
ESFP	I think we need the feminine qualities of leadership , which include attention to aesthetics and the environment , nurturing , affection , intuition and the qualities that make people feel safe and cared for .
ENTJ	Character matters leadership descends from character .
ISTP	In our system leadership is by consent , not command . To lead a President must persuade . Personal contacts and experiences help shape his thinking . They can be critical to his persuasiveness and thus to his leadership .
ISTP	Do n't necessarily avoid sharp edges . Occasionally they are necessary to leadership .
ENTJ	There 's a void of leadership in a lot of Washington . I think one of the reasons why there 's so much angst across the country .
INTJ	Absolute identity with one 's cause is the first and great condition of successful leadership .
ISTP	Presidential leadership need n't always cost money . Look for low- and no-cost options . They can be surprisingly effective .
ISFJ	Ever since Israel has been a nation the United States has provided the leadership . Every president down to the ages has done this in a fairly balanced way , including George Bush senior , Gerald Ford , and others including myself and Bill Clinton .
ENTJ	But I do not believe that the world would be entirely different if there were more women leaders . Maybe if everybody in leadership was a woman , you might not get into the conflicts in the first place . But if you watch the women who have made it to the top , they have n't exactly been non-aggressive - including me .
ENTJ	Maybe if everybody in leadership was a woman , you might not get into the conflicts in the first place . But if you watch the women who have made it to the top , they have n't exactly been non-aggressive - including me .
ESTJ	It simply can not be disputed that for decades the Palestinian leadership was more interested in there not being a Jewish state than in there being a Palestinian state .
ISTJ	Market leadership can translate directly to higher revenue , higher profitability , greater capital velocity , and correspondingly stronger returns on invested capital .
ENTJ	While Mayor Daley surprised me today with his decision to not run for reelection , I have never been surprised by his leadership , dedication and tireless work on behalf of the city and the people of Chicago .
ENTJ	Whose leadership , whose judgment , whose values do you want in the White House when that crisis lands like a thud on the Oval Office desk ?
ENTJ	The person who takes the oath of office in the next four months will shape not just the next four years , but the next forty years of our nation . In these next four years , we need proven leadership , proven judgment and proven values . America needs four more years of President Barack Obama .
ISTJ	If there is such a thing as good leadership , it is to give a good example . I have to do so for all the Ikea employees .
ESTJ	We needed to go back on the offense and offer clear leadership on Iraq .
ESTJ	I talked about the need for American leadership , I talked about the importance of the United States to a more peaceful world , a world that has been quite turbulent in recent years , and needs a strong American anchor .
INTJ	Even after such milestones as Kathryn Bigelow winning an Oscar , there still seem to be few women in leadership roles .
ENFJ	We must learn to live together as brothers or perish together as fools .
INFJ	Live as if you were to die tomorrow . Learn as if you were to live forever .
INTP	If we knew what it was we were doing , it would not be called research , would it ?
ISTP	A wise man can learn more from a foolish question than a fool can learn from a wise answer .
ENTP	Tell me and I forget . Teach me and I remember . Involve me and I learn .
ESFP	The secret of success is learning how to use pain and pleasure instead of having pain and pleasure use you . If you do that , you 're in control of your life . If you do n't , life controls you .
ESTP	Every immigrant who comes here should be required within five years to learn English or leave the country .
ESTP	I am always ready to learn although I do not always like being taught .
INTJ	He who would learn to fly one day must first learn to stand and walk and run and climb and dance one can not fly into flying .
ESTP	Without pain , there would be no suffering , without suffering we would never learn from our mistakes . To make it right , pain and suffering is the key to all windows , without it , there is no way of life .
ESTJ	Life is a series of experiences , each one of which makes us bigger , even though sometimes it is hard to realize this . For the world was built to develop character , and we must learn that the setbacks and grieves which we endure help us in our marching onward .
ENTP	Being ignorant is not so much a shame , as being unwilling to learn .
ISTP	To know oneself is to study oneself in action with another person .
ISFP	Everything I learned I learned from the movies .
ESFP	Deficiency motivation does n't work . It will lead to a life-long pursuit of try to fix me . Learn to appreciate what you have and where and who you are .
ENTJ	Your most unhappy customers are your greatest source of learning .
ESFP	The things that have been most valuable to me I did not learn in school .
ESTJ	We learned about honesty and integrity - that the truth matters ... that you do n't take shortcuts or play by your own set of rules ... and success does n't count unless you earn it fair and square .
ESTP	Prepare for the unknown by studying how others in the past have coped with the unforeseeable and the unpredictable .
INTJ	What we face may look insurmountable . But I learned something from all those years of training and competing . I learned something from all those sets and reps when I did n't think I could lift another ounce of weight . What I learned is that we are always stronger than we know .
ISFJ	You make mistakes , but I do n't have any regrets . I 'm the kind of person who takes responsibility for it and deals with it . I learn from everything I do . I work very hard , I have so many things going on in my life . Get to know me and see who I am .
ESFP	You do n't learn to walk by following rules . You learn by doing , and by falling over .
ISTP	Study strategy over the years and achieve the spirit of the warrior . Today is victory over yourself of yesterday tomorrow is your victory over lesser men .
ISTJ	I do n't love studying . I hate studying . I like learning . Learning is beautiful .
ESTP	The minute that you 're not learning I believe you 're dead .
ENFP	Everybody who is incapable of learning has taken to teaching .
ISFP	A lot of the problems I had with fame I was bringing on myself . A lot of self-loathing , a lot of woe-is-me . Now I 'm learning to see the positive side of things , instead of , like , 'I ca n't go to Kmart . I ca n't take my kids to the haunted house . '
ISTP	Each year has been so robust with problems and successes and learning experiences and human experienes that a year is a lifetime at Apple . So this has been ten lifetimes .
INTJ	When man learns to understand and control his own behavior as well as he is learning to understand and control the behavior of crop plants and domestic animals , he may be justified in believing that he has become civilized .
ISFJ	Some of the companies we helped start are names you know . An office supply company called Staples - where I 'm pleased to see the Obama campaign has been shopping The Sports Authority , which became a favorite of my sons . We started an early childhood learning center called Bright Horizons that First Lady Michelle Obama rightly praised .
ESFJ	The only things worth learning are the things you learn after you know it all .
INFP	People need to be made more aware of the need to work at learning how to live because life is so quick and sometimes it goes away too quickly .
INTJ	Much learning does not teach understanding .
ENFP	I 'd like to be more patient ! I just want everything now . I 've tried to meditate , but it 's really hard for me to stay still . I 'd like to try to force myself to do it , because everybody says how wonderful meditation is for you , but I ca n't shut my mind up . So patience and learning is the key .
INFJ	The highest activity a human being can attain is learning for understanding , because to understand is to be free .
INTP	What spectacle can be more edifying or more seasonable , than that of Liberty and Learning , each leaning on the other for their mutual and surest support ?
ESTP	You are n't learning anything when you 're talking .

ISFP	The spotlight will always be on me , but it 's something I 'm learning to live with as the years go by .

ISFP	I love nature and enjoy learning new skills .
ISFP	There 's no learning without trying lots of ideas and failing lots of times .

ESFJ	When I was first learning songs , I 'd have a favorite song , and I 'd take the chords and twist them around . I 'd learn the chords and then play them backward . That was my first experimenting with writing a song .

ENTP	Being a geek is all about learning the inventories of things .

ENTP	The Supreme Court ruled that disabled golfer Casey Martin has a legal right to ride in a golf cart between shots at PGA Tour events . Man , the next thing you know , they 're going to have some guy carry his clubs around for him .
ISTJ	We must have great respect for these people who also suffer and who want to find their own way of correct living . On the other hand , to create a legal form of a kind of homosexual marriage , in reality , does not help these people .

ENFP	We get information in the mail , the regular postal mail , encrypted or not , vet it like a regular news organization , format it - which is sometimes something that 's quite hard to do , when you 're talking about giant databases of information - release it to the public and then defend ourselves against the inevitable legal and political attacks .
ISTJ	Above all , we must have great respect for these people who also suffer and who want to find their own way of correct living . On the other hand , to create a legal form of a kind of homosexual marriage , in reality , does not help these people .

ENTP	Life 's Tragedy is that we get old to soon and wise too late .

ESTP	My rule of life prescribed as an absolutely sacred rite smoking cigars and also the drinking of alcohol before , after and if need be during all meals and in the intervals between them .

INFP	Life is as tedious as twice-told tale , vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man .

ENFJ	There is no passion to be found playing small - in settling for a life that is less than the one you are capable of living .
ESTP	Nothing in life is so exhilarating as to be shot at without result .

ENFP	I put all my genius into my life I put only my talent into my works .

INFP	I bear a charmed life .
ENFP	In married life three is company and two none .

INTJ	Judgments , value judgments concerning life , for or against , can in the last resort never be true : they possess value only as symptoms , they come into consideration only as symptoms - in themselves such judgments are stupidities .
INTJ	There are people who want to make men 's lives more difficult for no other reason than the chance it provides them afterwards to offer their prescription for alleviating life their Christianity , for instance .
ESFP	My definition of success is to live your life in a way that causes you to feel a ton of pleasure and very little pain - and because of your lifestyle , have the people around you feel a lot more pleasure than they do pain .

ESTJ	And Barack and I were raised with so many of the same values , like you work hard for what you want in life . That your word is your bond that you do what you say you 're going to do . That you treat people with dignity and respect , even if you do n't know them and even if you do n't agree with them .
ENFJ	The struggle of my life created empathy - I could relate to pain , being abandoned , having people not love me .

INFP	We continue to shape our personality all our life . If we knew ourselves perfectly , we should die .
ENTJ	It is better to create than to learn ! Creating is the essence of life .
ISTP	These technologies can make life easier , can let us touch people we might not otherwise . You may have a child with a birth defect and be able to get in touch with other parents and support groups , get medical information , the latest experimental drugs . These things can profoundly influence life . I 'm not downplaying that .
ISFP	Life is very interesting ... in the end , some of your greatest pains , become your greatest strengths .

ENTJ	I actually thought that it would be a little confusing during the same period of your life to be in one meeting when you 're trying to make money , and then go to another meeting where you 're giving it away . I mean is it gon na erode your ability , you know , to make money ? Are you gon na somehow get confused about what you 're trying to do ?
ISFP	At times in my life the only place I have been happy is when I am on stage .
INFP	He who binds to himself a joy Does the winged life destroy But he who kisses the joy as it flies Lives in eternity 's sun rise .

ENFP	It is a bit embarrassing to have been concerned with the human problem all one 's life and find at the end that one has no more to offer by way of advice than 'try to be a little kinder . '
INTP	Sometimes you trust someone who turns out not to be honest . There are a lot of things that happen in life that do n't turn out the way you 're given the impression that they will . And I think that 's all kind of a con . But I think we 've probably all been hurt .
ESFJ	My guiding principles in life are to be honest , genuine , thoughtful and caring .

ESTP	All my life I 've looked at words as though I were seeing them for the first time .
INTJ	I do n't believe in an afterlife , so I do n't have to spend my whole life fearing hell , or fearing heaven even more . For whatever the tortures of hell , I think the boredom of heaven would be even worse .
ESTJ	As we advance in life we learn the limits of our abilities .

ISTJ	We are never so defensless against suffering as when we love .

ENTJ	I love argument , I love debate . I do n't expect anyone just to sit there and agree with me , that 's not their job .
ISTJ	Whoever loves becomes humble . Those who love have , so to speak , pawned a part of their narcissism .

ENTJ	It is not the creation of wealth that is wrong , but the love of money for its own sake .
ENFP	You should hurry up and acquire the cigar habit . It 's one of the major happinesses . And so much more lasting than love , so much less costly in emotional wear and tear .
INTJ	We do not judge the people we love .
ENFJ	If a person loves only one other person and is indifferent to all others , his love is not love but a symbiotic attachment , or an enlarged egotism .

INFP	One can not think well , love well , sleep well , if one has not dined well .
ESFP	Music is what I breath , what I love to do . It keeps me alive .
ESTP	I love to put on lotion . Sometimes I 'll watch TV and go into a lotion trance for an hour . I try to find brands that do n't taste bad in case anyone wants to taste me .
ISFP	I do n't know if I believe in love at first sight , but of course I believe in two people having chemistry right away . A girl should be really easy to talk to . When I lose track of time because we 've been talking , I think that 's really fun .
ISFP	Everything that I love is behind those gates . We have elephants , and giraffes , and crocodiles , and every kind of tigers and lions . And - and we have bus loads of kids , who do n't get to see those things . They come up sick children , and enjoy it .
ENTJ	Only the really plain people know about love - the very fascinating ones try so hard to create an impression that they soon exhaust their talents .
INFP	Love seeketh not itself to please , nor for itself hath any care , but for another gives its ease , and builds a Heaven in Hell 's despair .

ISTJ	Love and work ... work and love , that 's all there is .
ESTJ	It sounds like a cliche but I also learnt that you 're not going to fall for the right person until you really love yourself and feel good about how you are .
ENTP	The distinction between children and adults , while probably useful for some purposes , is at bottom a specious one , I feel . There are only individual egos , crazy for love .
ENFP	If we 're destroying our trees and destroying our environment and hurting animals and hurting one another and all that stuff , there 's got to be a very powerful energy to fight that . I think we need more love in the world . We need more kindness , more compassion , more joy , more laughter . I definitely want to contribute to that .
ISTP	People love westerns worldwide . There 's something fantasy-like about an individual fighting the elements . Or even bad guys and the elements . It 's a simpler time . There 's no organized laws and stuff .

ENTJ	People everywhere love Windows .
INFJ	I tore myself away from the safe comfort of certainties through my love for truth - and truth rewarded me .

ESTJ	You do n't walk away if you love someone . You help the person .
ENFJ	Love is union with somebody , or something , outside oneself , under the condition of retaining the separateness and integrity of one 's own self .

ESTP	I 'm getting a wrinkle above my eyebrow because I just ca n't stop lifting it , and I love that you know .
INFP	I usually get myself into situations that cause sparks . I mean I 'm a girl that likes the storms . I love feeling alive , I love walking out in the cold in my bare feet and feeling the ice on my toes .
ENFJ	There is hardly any activity , any enterprise , which is started out with such tremendous hopes and expectations , and yet which fails so regularly , as love .
ENFP	The impulse to cruelty is , in many people , almost as violent as the impulse to sexual love - almost as violent and much more mischievous .
ESTP	They 're right to think that about me , because I 'm the person most likely to sleep with my female fans , I genuinely love other women . And I think they know that .
ENFJ	Love is often nothing but a favorable exchange between two people who get the most of what they can expect , considering their value on the personality market .
INFJ	When you 're taught to love everyone , to love your enemies , then what value does that place on love ?
ESTP	I am deeply grateful to the citizens of Sarajevo and the Sarajevo Canton assembly for bestowing upon me this incredible honor of citizenship . I am so proud to now be a part of such an extraordinary part of the world and fellow citizen to the people I deeply love and admire .
ESTJ	At the end of the day , you know , love does not happen between two perfect people as much as we would wish .
ENFP	How can a woman be expected to be happy with a man who insists on treating her as if she were a perfectly normal human being .
INTP	Marriage is neither heaven nor hell , it is simply purgatory .
ESTP	I have learned that only two things are necessary to keep one 's wife happy . First , let her think she 's having her own way . And second , let her have it .
ENFP	There is nothing in the world like the devotion of a married woman . It is a thing no married man knows anything about .

ENTP	Keep your eyes wide open before marriage , half shut afterwards .

ENTJ	Marriage is a series of desperate arguments people feel passionately about .
ENFJ	I think women are natural caretakers . They take care of everybody . They take care of their husbands and their kids and their dogs , and do n't spend a lot of time just getting back and taking time out .
ISFP	There were three of us in this marriage , so it was a bit crowded .
ENFP	Wit is the sudden marriage of ideas which before their union were not perceived to have any relation .
ENFP	How marriage ruins a man ! It is as demoralizing as cigarettes , and far more expensive .
ENTP	I believe marriage is between a man and a woman . I am not in favor of gay marriage . But when you start playing around with constitutions , just to prohibit somebody who cares about another person , it just seems to me that 's not what America 's about . Usually , our constitutions expand liberties , they do n't contract them .
ENFP	So many people prefer to live in drama because it 's comfortable . It 's like someone staying in a bad marriage or relationship - it 's actually easier to stay because they know what to expect every day , versus leaving and not knowing what to expect .
ISFP	Marriage destroyed my relationship with two wonderful men .
ISFJ	I feel very deeply about the need to respect and tolerate people of different social - or sexual orientation . But at the same time , I believe marriage should be preserved as an institution for one man and one woman .
ENTP	I opposed the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996 . It should be repealed and I will vote for its repeal on the Senate floor . I will also oppose any proposal to amend the U.S. Constitution to ban gays and lesbians from marrying .
ISTP	Having federal officials , whether judges , bureaucrats , or congressmen , impose a new definition of marriage on the people is an act of social engineering profoundly hostile to liberty .
ENTP	What I believe is that marriage is between a man and a woman , but what I also believe is that we have an obligation to make sure that gays and lesbians have the rights of citizenship that afford them visitations to hospitals , that allow them to be , to transfer property between partners , to make certain that they 're not discriminated on the job .
INTJ	I think that gay marriage should be between a man and a woman .
ISFJ	My decision to end my marriage was such a risk to lose ratings and lose my fan base . I had to take that risk for my inner peace and to be happy with myself .
ENTP	Divorce is probably of nearly the same date as marriage . I believe , however , that marriage is some weeks the more ancient .
ISFJ	My view is that marriage is a relationship between a man and a woman . That 's the position I 've had for some time , and I do n't intend to make any adjustments at this point ... Or ever , by the way .
ENTP	I think there are a whole host of things that are civil rights , and then there are other things - such as traditional marriage - that , I think , express a community 's concern and regard for a particular institution .
ENTP	I do n't think marriage is a civil right , but I think that being able to transfer property is a civil right .
ENTP	Marriage is for women the commonest mode of livelihood , and the total amount of undesired sex endured by women is probably greater in marriage than in prostitution .
ISFJ	Culture , what you believe , what you value , how you live matters . Now , as fundamental as these principles are , they may become topics of democratic debates from time to time , so it is today with the enduring institution of marriage . Marriage is a relationship between a man and a woman .
ESTJ	Well I think in a marriage you have to be honest and ask yourself , you know , what is my role ? What is my responsibility ?
ESTJ	I have not supported same-sex marriage . I have supported civil partnerships and contractual relationships .
ESTJ	Every marriage is a mystery to me , even the one I 'm in . So I 'm no expert on it .
ESFJ	I respect the fact that many denominations have different points of view with respect to gay marriage and they can hold that in the sanctity in the place of their religion and not bless them or solemnize them .
ENTP	Whenever the people are for gay marriage or medical marijuana or assisted suicide , suddenly the 'will of the people ' goes out the window .
INTP	It is always incomprehensible to a man that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage .
ISFP	I think like any marriage , especially when you 've had divorced parents like myself you want to try even harder to make it work .
INFJ	Marriage changes everything .
ENFP	I would love to have the same rights as everybody else . I would love , I do n't care if it 's called marriage . I do n't care if it 's called , you know , domestic partnership . I do n't care what it 's called .
ESTP	Our Nation must defend the sanctity of marriage .
ENFP	Marriage is like a game of chess except the board is flowing water , the pieces are made of smoke and no move you make will have any effect on the outcome .
ISFP	Gay marriage is going to happen . It must .
ESTP	I believe a marriage is between a man and a woman .
ISFP	Sometimes I bust out and do things so permanent . Like tattoos and marriage .
ENFP	Marriage is wonderful .
ENFP	Marriage brings up all the things I pushed to the back burner - the fears , the mistrust , the doubts , the insecurities . It 's like opening Pandora 's box .
ISFP	I 've always been suspicious of TV , I 've always found music and video to be an unhappy marriage .
ESFP	After about 20 years of marriage , I 'm finally starting to scratch the surface of what women want . And I think the answer lies somewhere between conversation and chocolate .
INFP	A key to keeping your husband is getting him to miss you . That keeps a marriage fresh .

INFP	I think even in a good marriage , especially if you stay together long enough , there are going to be events that happen .
ESFP	The press is just not your friend when it comes to a marriage . That 's why we did n't sell the pictures of our wedding , and we got offered millions of dollars for them , millions .
ESFJ	I 'll always be sad that my marriage ended .
ESTP	I never had a policy about marriage . I got married very young in life and I always think in all relationships , I 've always thought that it 's counterproductive to have a theory on that .
ENFJ	Marriage is this grand madness , and I think if people knew that , they would perhaps take it more seriously .
ISFP	After a while in marriage , it does n't work anymore . There is something missing , there is something wrong . There are few marriages that stay alive forever . We like something , and after a while , we hate what we used to love .
ISTJ	I 'm not convinced about marriage . Divorce is so easy , and that fact that gay people are not allowed to marry takes much of the meaning out of it . Committing yourself to one person is sacred .
ESFJ	I thought the divorce statistics would never apply to me . I was beyond heartbroken when they did . But I got up and got on with it . I also kept my belief in marriage .
ISFJ	A marriage does n't have to be perfect , but you can be perfect for each other .
INFJ	Marriage is a risk I think it 's a great and glorious risk , as long as you embark on the adventure in the same spirit .
ENTP	I did n't think marriage worked . I thought everybody who was married was secretly miserable - that it was something they just put up with for their children .
ENFP	Now I 'm a wife and a mother of two . It 's a really different role . I always referred to No Doubt as a marriage , because that 's what it 's like to be together for so long and go through what we 've been through . I ca n't really have that relationship with them anymore .
ENFP	A miracle ... my biggest accomplishment is my marriage so far . Because it 's hard , everyone knows it 's hard .
ENTJ	I believe in traditional marriage .
ENTJ	Well , marriage is a very important part of our culture and our society . If we want to have a hopeful and decent society , we ought to aim for the ideal .
ESTP	Marriage has n't been my thing . But gay people , knock yourselves out !
ESFJ	I do n't have this fantasy about marriage anymore . Everyone says it takes hard work . Well , it kind of does - and I 'm much more pragmatic about romance than I used to be .
ESFJ	The rule with marriage is the less you talk about it the better , as far as I can tell .
ESFJ	While 45 of the 50 States have either a State constitutional amendment or a statute that preserves the current definition of marriage , left-wing activist judges and officials at the local levels have struck down State laws protecting marriage .
ESFJ	And that is why marriage and family law has emphasized the importance of marriage as the foundation of family , addressing the needs of children in the most positive way .
ESTJ	When David Arquette and I got engaged we started therapy together . I 'd heard that the first year of marriage is the hardest , so we decided to work through all that stuff early .
ESTJ	Is marriage for ever ? I think you get married with the intention that it will be , but who knows ?
ESTJ	It 's so easy to grow apart marriage takes work .
ISTP	The truth is you can have a great marriage , but there are still no guarantees .
ESFP	And in a marriage you ca n't TRY and be married . You 're married or you 're not married ... as far as I 'm concerned .
ESFJ	I 'm always told that what I say is controversial . Why is it controversial ? Because I speak from a tradition that has now fallen out of favor with the dominant media in this country . And so when I say things like marriage should be between one man and one woman , I 'm called a bigot .
ESTJ	Any sex outside of the marriage bond between a man and a woman is violating God 's law .
ESFP	I was very influenced by the musicals and romantic comedies of the 1930s . I admired Gene Harlow and such , which probably explains why , since the end of my marriage , I 've dated nothing but a succession of blondes .
ENFP	I also think it was important for me and Freddie to be able to have a lot of time to share our lives at the beginning of our marriage rather than my coming home at 9 or 10 at night from the set . Things have really worked out for the best for both of us .

ESFJ	Is n't that the ultimate homeland security , standing up and defending marriage ?

ENTP	I think gay marriage should be the national law .
ENTP	They make Spy Kids , they make Scream , they make A Scary Movie . This does n't do that , so it could be a very bad marriage . I 'm trying to keep this potential nightmare quiet because we 're just finishing editing .

ENTJ	Doctors will have more lives to answer for in the next world than even we generals .
INTJ	All sorts of computer errors are now turning up . You 'd be surprised to know the number of doctors who claim they are treating pregnant men .

ENFP	The Christian 's Bible is a drug store . Its contents remain the same , but the medical practice changes .

ENTJ	What 's important at the grocery store is just as important in engines or medical systems . If the customer is n't satisfied , if the stuff is getting stale , if the shelf is n't right , or if the offerings are n't right , it 's the same thing . You manage it like a small organization . You do n't get hung up on zeros .

INFP	All the world 's a stage , and all the men and women merely players : they have their exits and their entrances and one man in his time plays many parts , his acts being seven ages .
ENFJ	Rarely do we find men who willingly engage in hard , solid thinking . There is an almost universal quest for easy answers and half-baked solutions . Nothing pains some people more than having to think .

ESFJ	When I was a little girl , rocking my little dolls , I remember thinking I would be the world 's best mom , and so far I 've done it .
ESFJ	Washington has got to , across the board , lower taxes for small businesses so that our mom and pops can reinvest and hire people , so that our businesses can thrive .
ENFP	Being a singer is all about me . About ego . Being a mom is all about being selfless - two different worlds .
ESFJ	My mom insisted on multigrain bread and never allowed soda in the house .
ISFP	I 'm more straightforward , and I speak up more than I did before . When I was younger , I would n't speak up as much , but now that I 'm a mom , things have changed .
ENFP	I was thinking that when I have children , that I should always dress as a character for them , so they think their mom is Alice in Wonderland or Cinderella .
ENFP	It 's superfun being a mom , but it 's hard too .
ENFP	Being a mom is hard , I think a lot of working moms feel that way .
ENFP	I was thinking that when I have children , that I should always dress as a character for them , so they think their mom is Alice in Wonderland or Cinderella . It would be totally messed up !
ENTJ	So far I 'm not surprised by anything about being a mom . It 's all pretty great - but that 's what I expected .
ESTP	There is nothing worse that a thirteen-year-old boy . You 're embarrassed by your parents , and you 're trying to find your independance because , deep inside , you are so dependent on your mom .
ESTP	A friend of my mom 's was a casting director so , really as kind of a lark , I had a couple of acting jobs that had just enough exposure to give me the option to continue if I wanted to . I followed through with it .
ESFJ	It 's about getting the kids up and fed , getting one to school , getting the other down for a nap , going to the grocery store , picking one up from school , getting the other one down for another nap , cooking dinner ... I live my life at these two extremes . I 'm either a full-time stay-at-home mom or a full-time actress .
ESFJ	I remember , my mom did n't have any help , so if she needed to be somewhere after school , we 'd just go down to the neighbors ' and she 'd give us a snack and make sure we did our homework . There were n't any latchkey kids .
ESFJ	My mom has always said that the one thing she wishes she had done differently is have a job . She felt like the single-mindedness made her a little nuts sometimes , and she could have used an outlet for herself when we were little .
ENFJ	My mom , she is the most unbelievable mom that you could ever have in your entire life and she 's always with me on everything . The most I 've ever been away from her is two days . I love her more than anybody could ever know .
ISFP	I 'm a soccer mom . I 'm T-ball , soccer , karate , homework , keeping them on their schedules . I love being the snack mom , when I get to bring the cut oranges . I have one of those coolers with wheels . I 'm at every game , every practice , sitting on my blanket . I love it .
ESTJ	My mom was a teacher - I have the greatest respect for the profession - we need great teachers - not poor or mediocre ones .
ESFJ	I lived with my mom in a really small apartment . My bedroom was like in the living room . That 's why I still love to sleep on couches now .
ESFJ	My mom is definitely my rock .
ESFJ	My mom always said , 'Do n't date a guy who thinks he 's prettier than you . '
ENFP	Everything I am is because of my mom .
INFP	My mom used to have a lot of European cinema playing in the house , so I 'd catch bits and pieces of films .
INTJ	I grew up in Marcy Projects in Brooklyn , and my mom and pop had an extensive record collection , so Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder and all of those sounds and souls of Motown filled the house .
INTJ	I had to take my makeup off at work every night . I was n't allowed to do it at home because my mom said that when your work day is done , you 're done with work .
ENTP	No , my mom kind of led me toward acting . She wanted to be an actress when she was younger . That made me interested in it when I was a kid , because she and I are very close .
ENTP	I was embarrassed that I even wanted to become an actress because coming from L.A. , with two older sisters in the business and a mom who had been a ballet dancer , it was such a cliche .
ISFP	We were poor . But my mom never accepted that . She worked hard to become a residential contractor - got her master 's with honors at the University of New Orleans . I used to go to every class with her . Her father was my paternal figure .
ESTJ	I 've learned that every working mom is a superwoman .
ESTJ	I 'm an actress and mom , and I probably do n't have enough of an active spiritual life . And I do n't know why people run around calling themselves by the names of religions when they do n't actually practise them .
ISFP	Sure , my childhood was unusual . All these eccentric , wild people frequented our home : rock stars , drag queens , models , bikers , freaks . But I was not this little rich girl . My mom and I lived in an apartment .
INTP	I grew up in a family of Republicans . And when I was 18 and registering to vote , my mom 's only instruction was 'You just go in and pull the big Republican lever . ' That 's my welcome to adulthood . She 's like , 'No , do n't even read it . Just pull the Republican lever .
ENFP	There is nothing like becoming a mom to fill you with fear .
ENFP	Trying to be Supermom is as futile as trying to be Perfect Mom . Not going to happen .
ISFJ	I 've looked at pictures that my mom has of me , from when I was four years old at the turntable . I 'm there , reaching up to play the records . I feel like I was bred to do what I do . I 've been into music , and listening to music and critiquing it , my whole life .
ENFJ	I 've always wanted to be an actress , ever since I was a little girl . I always played the mom and I played my sister as the daughter . I wanted to be an actress on television and movies instead of just around the house .
ESTJ	I think my mom threatened to put me up for adoption a few times .
ESTP	My mom and my dad wanted my brother and I to have a better life , you know , better education , better jobs . It was probably harder , much , much harder , for my parents . When you 're a kid , you can learn a language much more easily I learned English in less than a year .
ISTP	My mom is still yelling at me because she needs more autographed pictures .
ESFJ	My mom , Emilie , always taught me to think hard about marriage .
ESFJ	My mom was a photographer and whenever they needed a baby for a modelling job , she 'd stick me in front of the camera . That 's how it started .

INTJ	Money is only a tool . It will take you wherever you wish , but it will not replace you as the driver .
INFP	It 's a kind of spiritual snobbery that makes people think they can be happy without money .

ENTJ	We 've got to put a lot of money into changing behavior .
ISTP	Money is better than poverty , if only for financial reasons .
INTP	No complaint ... is more common than that of a scarcity of money .
INTJ	Most men love money and security more , and creation and construction less , as they get older .
ENFJ	A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual doom .
INTP	I can make more generals , but horses cost money .
ISTJ	Rule No.1 : Never lose money . Rule No.2 : Never forget rule No.1 .
ESFP	Too many people spend money they have n't earned to buy things they do n't want to impress people they do n't like .
ESFP	I 've never been able to understand why a Republican contributor is a 'fat cat ' and a Democratic contributor of the same amount of money is a 'public-spirited philanthropist ' .
INFJ	Never spend your money before you have earned it .
INFJ	Money , not morality , is the principle commerce of civilized nations .
ISFP	I do n't want to make money , I just want to be wonderful .
ISFP	What 's money ? A man is a success if he gets up in the morning and goes to bed at night and in between does what he wants to do .

ENTP	If you would know the value of money , go and try to borrow some .

ISFP	An actress is not a machine , but they treat you like a machine . A money machine .
ENTP	Remember that credit is money .
ENTP	The use of money is all the advantage there is in having it .

ISFP	Do n't matter how much money you got , there 's only two kinds of people : there 's saved people and there 's lost people .
ESFP	Successful people make money . It 's not that people who make money become successful , but that successful people attract money . They bring success to what they do .
ISTP	It 's hard to tell with these Internet startups if they 're really interested in building companies or if they 're just interested in the money . I can tell you , though : If they do n't really want to build a company , they wo n't luck into it . That 's because it 's so hard that if you do n't have a passion , you 'll give up .
ISTJ	Of the billionaires I have known , money just brings out the basic traits in them . If they were jerks before they had money , they are simply jerks with a billion dollars .
ISTJ	I never attempt to make money on the stock market . I buy on the assumption that they could close the market the next day and not reopen it for five years .
ISTP	Innovation has nothing to do with how many R amp & D dollars you have . When Apple came up with the Mac , IBM was spending at least 100 times more on R & amp D. It 's not about money . It 's about the people you have , how you 're led , and how much you get it .
ISTP	Pretty much , Apple and Dell are the only ones in this industry making money . They make it by being Wal-Mart . We make it by innovation .
ISTP	You know , my main reaction to this money thing is that it 's humorous , all the attention to it , because it 's hardly the most insightful or valuable thing that 's happened to me .
ENTP	We need earmark reform , and when I 'm President , I will go line by line to make sure that we are not spending money unwisely .
ISFP	Money does n't talk , it swears .
ISTP	With our technology , with objects , literally three people in a garage can blow away what 200 people at Microsoft can do . Literally can blow it away . Corporate America has a need that is so huge and can save them so much money , or make them so much money , or cost them so much money if they miss it , that they are going to fuel the object revolution .
ISTP	This film cost $ 31 million . With that kind of money I could have invaded some country .

ENFP	You reach a point where you do n't work for money .
INTJ	Money does n't make you happy . I now have $ 50 million but I was just as happy when I had $ 48 million .

ENTP	When it is a question of money , everybody is of the same religion .
ESTJ	Money is like an arm or leg - use it or lose it .
ENTP	I know that campaigns can seem small , and even silly . Trivial things become big distractions . Serious issues become sound bites . And the truth gets buried under an avalanche of money and advertising . If you 're sick of hearing me approve this message , believe me - so am I .
ISFJ	Now workers should have the right to join unions . But unions should not be forced upon workers . And unions should not have the power to take money our of their members ' paychecks to buy the support of politicians that are favored by the union bosses .
ISTP	I went to the bank and asked to borrow a cup of money . They said , 'What for ? ' I said , 'I 'm going to buy some sugar . '
INFJ	A real gentleman , even if he loses everything he owns , must show no emotion . Money must be so far beneath a gentleman that it is hardly worth troubling about .
ESTP	I do n't think the money people in Hollywood have ever thought I was normal , but I am dedicated to my work and that 's what counts .
INTP	Labour was the first price , the original purchase - money that was paid for all things . It was not by gold or by silver , but by labour , that all wealth of the world was originally purchased .
INTJ	The writer must earn money in order to be able to live and to write , but he must by no means live and write for the purpose of making money .
ESFP	I 'd have stopped writing years ago if it were for the money .
ESFJ	There is no class so pitiably wretched as that which possesses money and nothing else .
ENTJ	The problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other peoples ' money .
INTJ	Capital is money , capital is commodities . By virtue of it being value , it has acquired the occult ability to add value to itself . It brings forth living offspring , or , at the least , lays golden eggs .
ENFJ	Now , people when I say that look at me and say , 'What are you talking about , Joe ? You 're telling me we have to go spend money to keep from going bankrupt ? ' . The answer is yes , that 's what I 'm telling you .
ESTJ	It is a fact that around the world the elites of every country are making money .
INFP	A woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction .
ESTJ	We ca n't go to people who have lost their job at GM and say , 'Oh , by the way , we are going to pay money to build a road here or inoculate children there , ' unless we can demonstrate that it is in America 's interest . I happen to think it is .
ESTJ	You know , people make a lot of money talking about me , do n't they ?
ESTP	Love him or hate him , Trump is a man who is certain about what he wants and sets out to get it , no holds barred . Women find his power almost as much of a turn-on as his money .
INFP	I 'd asked around 10 or 15 people for suggestions . Finally one lady friend asked the right question , 'Well , what do you love most ? ' That 's how I started painting money .
ISTP	Right now it 's only a notion , but I think I can get the money to make it into a concept , and later turn it into an idea .
ESTP	I do n't make deals for the money . I 've got enough , much more than I 'll ever need . I do it to do it .
INFP	Want of money and the distress of a thief can never be alleged as the cause of his thieving , for many honest people endure greater hardships with fortitude . We must therefore seek the cause elsewhere than in want of money , for that is the miser 's passion , not the thief s .
INFP	To the eyes of a miser a guinea is more beautiful than the sun , and a bag worn with the use of money has more beautiful proportions than a vine filled with grapes .
ESFP	For a successful entrepreneur it can mean extreme wealth . But with extreme wealth comes extreme responsibility . And the responsibility for me is to invest in creating new businesses , create jobs , employ people , and to put money aside to tackle issues where we can make a difference .
INTJ	Even with my divorce and with everything , I do n't need money .
INTJ	I have plenty of money , unlike other Hollywood celebrities or athletes that have not invested well .
ENTJ	The focus on my appearance has really surprised me . I 've always been a size 14 to 16 , I do n't care about clothes , I 'd rather spend my money on cigarettes and booze .
ISFJ	If money titles meant anything , I 'd play more tournaments . The only thing that means a lot to me is winning . If I have more wins than anybody else and win more majors than anybody else in the same year , then it 's been a good year .

ENTJ	Well , the chairman of Federal Reserve just made his move to rescue Barack Obama . We 're gon na have QE3 . We 're gon na print some more money .
ISFP	I do n't want to make money I want to make a difference .
INTP	Look , I 'm very much in favor of tax cuts , but not with borrowed money . And the problem that we 've gotten into in recent years is spending programs with borrowed money , tax cuts with borrowed money , and at the end of the day that proves disastrous . And my view is I do n't think we can play subtle policy here .
ISFP	I decided to pursue music , so I dropped out of school and I told my parents I did n't want any money from them . I got three jobs and I just hit the ground running .
ENFP	A lot of people in the media , and some everyday people , really are n't in search of the truth . They 're in search of something worse than that . Money , yeah . I think the media 's the kind of a thing where the truth does n't win , because it 's no fun . The truth 's no fun .
ESTJ	Clearly this is a tough economic time , and a lot of families are hurting . So when we talk to parents , we talk about small changes for kids and things that do n't cost extra money . Like adding water and eliminating sugary drinks and sodas . That 's going to save money right there . Or adding a few more vegetables .
ENTP	The idea that a congressman would be tainted by accepting money from private industry or private sources is essentially a socialist argument .
ISTP	Congress , the press , and the bureaucracy too often focus on how much money or effort is spent , rather than whether the money or effort actually achieves the announced goal .
INTJ	Of course , I do everything for money .
INFP	Money is the seed of money , and the first guinea is sometimes more difficult to acquire than the second million .
ISFP	Some artists are working to buy the mansion or whatever the element of fame must bear , but I spend all my money on my show .
ISFP	I do n't care about money .
INFP	I definitely spend the most money on shoes , partly because vintage footwear can be a little funky - in a bad way . I like to keep things pretty simple up top and then go weird with the shoes .
ESFJ	I 'm free of stress and worries now because if I do n't like something I 'm doing , I just find the fun in it instead of being miserable . Let me have fun with the people I work with , let me have fun making money - when I grew up so poor , ya know ?
INTJ	This is our commitment to users and the people who use our service , is that Facebook 's a free service . It 's free now . It will always be free . We make money through having advertisements and things like that .

INTP	Labor was the first price , the original purchase - money that was paid for all things .
ISFJ	Money and fame made me believe I was entitled . I was wrong and foolish .
ISFJ	I felt that I had worked hard my entire life and deserved to enjoy all the temptations around me . I felt I was entitled , and thanks to money and fame , I did n't have to go far to find them .
ESTP	We are going as fast as we can as soon as we can . We 're in a race against time , until we run out of money .
ENFP	I do n't know what to do with it . I 'm very fortunate to have it , and it gives you room to maneuver . But the main thing about having money is it means you do n't have to worry about it . And that for me is a lovely thing . It 's not for fast cars and hookers .
ENTP	Only the elites despise earning money .
ESFP	I 've got my eye on a few things to spend my money on . I 've got my own bank card but I am really good with money . I do n't spend too much at all .
ESFP	You have to spend a lot to make a lot . It 's not like I 'm sitting on top of a pile of money .
INTJ	As kids we did n't complain about being poor we talked about how rich we were going to be and made moves to get the lifestyle we aspired to by any means we could . And as soon as we had a little money , we were eager to show it .
ISFP	My body ca n't put anyone in jeopardy of not making money anymore - my body is just not on the table that way anymore .
ENFP	I have no idea how much money I 've got .
INFP	You 're right on the money with that . We 're all like detectives in life . There 's something at the end of the trail that we 're all looking for .
ESFJ	I like my money right where I can see it ... hanging in my closet .
ESFP	Hollywood is so fake and people need to realize that people are just people , and you , too , do n't need to be born into something or have money or have whatever product someone is hawking on you .
ESTJ	I think that lawyers are terrible at admitting that they 're wrong . And not just admitting it also realizing it . Most lawyers are very successful , and they think that because they 're making money and people think well of them , they must be doing everything right .
ENTP	I think that money spoils most things , once it becomes the primary motivating force .
ESTP	Expensive clothes are a waste of money .
ENTJ	Hussein has chosen to spend his money on building weapons of mass destruction and palaces for his cronies .
ESFP	Ridiculous yachts and private planes and big limousines wo n't make people enjoy life more , and it sends out terrible messages to the people who work for them . It would be so much better if that money was spent in Africa - and it 's about getting a balance .
ESFP	I grew up in a really small town with not a lot of money , and I liked singing , but it was just something that was a hobby .

ESFJ	I have a lot of money stashed away , but I do live my life from day to day .
ESFP	First and foremost I am a drummer . After that , I 'm other things ... But I did n't play drums to make money .
ESTP	Financially , I 've lost money and made money , but I know my way around financially .
ENFJ	Selling out is doing something you do n't really want to do for money . That 's what selling out is .
ENTJ	I actually think that the economy has got some positives . It 's got the market . It 's got consumer confidence and it 's got banks throwing - I mean central bankers throwing money at it around the world .
ESTJ	Let 's be honest , I have enough money to never have to work again .
ISTJ	If anyone tells you it 's impossible to be fabulous and smart and make a ton of money using math , well , they can just get in line behind you - and kiss your math .
INFP	Money is n't important , but you have to have enough , so you do n't have to think about it . Thinking about money is a drag .
ENTP	Money is everywhere but so is poetry . What we lack are the poets .
ENFJ	My recollection is - and I 'd have to confirm this - but I do n't recall paying any money to go to law school .
ESFJ	I used to get my money at the end of the week , buy my mum something , or buy a record , and that was it .

ESFJ	It ai n't as bad as you think . It will look better in the morning .
ESFJ	I remind myself every morning : Nothing I say this day will teach me anything . So if I 'm going to learn , I must do it by listening .
ESTP	I may be drunk , Miss , but in the morning I will be sober and you will still be ugly .
ISFJ	And this President wakes up every morning , looks out across America and is proud to announce , 'It could be worse . ' It could be worse ? Is that what it means to be an American ? It could be worse ? Of course not . What defines us as Americans is our unwavering conviction that we know it must be better .
ENTJ	Just in terms of allocation of time resources , religion is not very efficient . There 's a lot more I could be doing on a Sunday morning .
ENFP	A leaf fluttered in through the window this morning , as if supported by the rays of the sun , a bird settled on the fire escape , joy in the task of coffee , joy accompanied me as I walked .
ENFP	The person who does n't scatter the morning dew will not comb gray hairs .
ESTP	To be intimate with a married man , when my own father cheated on my mother , is not something I could forgive . I could not look at myself in the morning if I did that . I would n't be attracted to a man who would cheat on his wife .
ENFJ	I have retired , but if there 's anything that would kill me it is to wake up in the morning not knowing what to do .
ESFP	I always do an all-night horror marathon on Saturdays where we start at seven and go until five in the morning .
ISFP	You wake up in the morning and you look at your old spoon , and you say to yourself , 'Mick , it 's time to get yourself a new spoon . ' And you do .
ESFP	I , of course , meditate for two hours every morning . It 's part of my schedule I wake up at 4 a.m. every day and I love it .
ENFP	What inspires you , what excites you when you wake up in the morning ?
ISFP	When I wake up in the morning , I feel just like any other insecure 24-year-old girl .
ISFP	I still , at hotel rooms , I do this one sort of not-so-cool thing : continually shoving my room service tray in front of someone else 's door . Because I do n't want the remnants . I do n't want to be caught , like , being like the pig that I was at two in the morning .
ISFJ	I 've just finished my 20th book this past year and I 'm working on my 21st book about the Middle East right now that I 'll finish this year . And I get up early in the morning and when I get tired of the computer and tired of doing research , I walk 20 steps out to my woodshop and I either build furniture or paint paintings . I 'm an artist too .
ESFP	I 'm very happy with the way I look . I wake up some morning , catch myself in the bathroom mirror , and go , 'hey girl , you 're alright ' . But on the other hand , I find the website stuff , and the polls , something completely removed from my own personal life . You ca n't take anything like that too seriously , otherwise you 'd end up in the loony bin .
ENTP	One morning , just like 9/11 , there 's going to be a disaster . I have yet to see the United Nations do anything effective with either Iran or North Korea .
ENTJ	Most of the time I spend when I get up in the morning is trying to figure out what is going to happen .
ISFP	Making love in the morning got me through morning sickness . I found I could be happy and throw up at the same time .
ENTP	I 'm not an employee who goes to the office every morning at the same time . Then , vacations are needed .
ENFJ	It did n't matter what you look like . You do n't have to get up at 5:30 in the morning and there 's a lot to be said for that . Corpse Bride can just play all my parts from now on and I 'll just do the voice .
ENFJ	It 's a privilege to serve the poor , to be servants of noble Africans , but I better belong in the rehearsal room or in the studio with my band . That 's where I want to be and I still wake up in the morning with melodies in my head .
ESTP	Let me tell you , it is still morning in America . It just happens to be kind of a head pounding , hung over for four hours in America - and it 's shaping up to be a nasty day , but its still morning in America .
ESTP	I was in Washington , D.C. , on the morning show , by the time I was 18 , programming a station by 19 , No . 1 in the mornings . I think I was making , I do n't know , a quarter of a million dollars by the time I was 25 .
ENTP	I hear that 5 o'clock whistle in my mind like Fred Flintstone and I have to stop . I 'm also not much of a morning writer . I have a sweet spot from about 11am to 4pm . But I really work during that time .
ISTP	I like being in movies that have a great story . I 'm not so interested in being a Hollywood star . It 's a job , you know . When you wake up at six in the morning every day for a week , it feels like hard work .
ESFJ	When I travel , I like to take advantage of room service . I 'm really into eggs Benedict in the morning .
ESTP	But when I felt like I had something to prove ? Then I got up early every morning and worked all day long . I did n't know if I had any more talent than anyone else directing , but I knew I could work hard at it , and so I did .
ENFP	Nowadays , everybody assumes , when they wake up in the morning , if they have a question , it will get answered . Because they have the internet . No matter what the question is , someone will answer their question .
INFJ	It 's never really that much fun for me to do movies anyway , because you - you know , you have to get up very early in the morning and you have to go in and you spend a lot of time waiting around .
ENTJ	I mean , if you have to wake up in the morning to be validated by the editorial page of the New York Times , you got a pretty sorry existence .
ISTP	What is news ? It 's hard to quantify . Certainly news has changed completely , and the morning shows are not really designed to bring you the news , except to tell you what happened overnight , and the rest of it is a kind of magazine mentality - a little bit of this , a little bit of that . It 's harder to be an educated and informed citizen .
INTJ	My days , if they start in the morning with a cuddle from my son , are just so much more glorious than they were prior to that .
ESFP	Sometimes I wake up in the morning and I am like , 'This is a high-top day ' or 'This is a bob day , ' but when I get my clothes on that 's when I see .
ESFP	When I get up in the morning and put on a pink or a green wig , I see myself as a piece of animation . It lets me be the person I want to be , a person who 's not embarrassed to have fun .
ISFJ	I wake up laughing . Yes , I wake up in the morning and there I am just laughing my head off .
INFJ	London is completely unpredictable when it comes to weather . You 'll start a scene , and it 's a beautiful morning . You get there at 6 in the morning , set up , you start the scene , start shooting . Three hours later , it is pitch black and rainy .
ESFJ	I have to say that when you tour the world , obviously , the jetlags and different hours and ways of living and traveling , a lot of hours in the plane , and you wake up in the morning and you 're not quite sure where you are , and it is very tiring .
INTP	If you 're changing the world , you 're working on important things . You 're excited to get up in the morning .
ENFP	The episodes all blend together for me , so I do n't remember . I ca n't even remember what I had for breakfast this morning . I always feel I must be such a disappointment to them .
ISFP	Every time I get up in the morning , melodies occur to me and I start trying to shape lyrics to melodies .
ENFP	I could announce one morning that the world was going to blow up in three hours and people would be calling in about my hair !
ENFP	But , you know , they do n't enjoy the dinner hour together . It 's just not as much of a ritual at night and it 's interesting . I think the ritual is taking place perhaps more in the morning .
ENFP	But of course when people watch morning television , Terry , it 's a very different animal . You know , they 're running around , they 're getting their kids ready for school , they 're probably doing eight million things , they 're brushing their teeth .
ENFP	All three networks have always had a morning show but now cable of course is taking some of that audience away and a variety of other things , probably the Internet as well .
ESFJ	I wake up every morning and I feel like I 'm juggling glass balls . I live in Los Angeles , my business is run out of London , and most evenings I 'm cuddled up in front of Skype , in my dressing gown , speaking with my studio in London . I travel a lot , my team travel a lot , but I would n't have it any other way .
ESFJ	I made it a morning show . We have the coffee cup , we have the morning papers . It 's got that feel to it , that 's what I wanted .
ESFJ	I 've done the best I can with the morning show . I made it a morning show . We have the coffee cup , you have the morning papers , you know , it 's got that feel to it , that 's what I wanted .
ESFJ	It means a lot in my business and its a wonderful feeling to be recognized for what you have done over a lifetime , but I did n't go crazy . I still eat my cereal in the morning , have a sandwich in the afternoon , go to bed at night . You know , nothing really different .
ENTP	I was up watching Meet Joe Black at four AM . I was hoping Brad Pitt would die , and he was still alive at seven forty in the morning ! I actually felt sorry for once , for critics .
INFJ	Sometimes it 's so weird just to do an interview . This morning I was back in my parents ' house , with my brother , and we went for a jog together , then had breakfast as a family . And a couple of hours later I 'm wearing high heels and a dress and makeup , and talking about my job .
ENFJ	I like everything perfect . Everything has to be neat . My sister is 5 , and she 's more messy than I am . I make my bed every morning , everything 's perfect . My shoes are all arranged . It 's sad . I 'm a little like Ray , a little bit .
INTJ	A creative man is motivated by the desire to achieve , not by the desire to beat others .
ESTP	If you 're going through hell , keep going .
ESFP	Be miserable . Or motivate yourself . Whatever has to be done , it 's always your choice .
ENFP	If you can dream it , you can do it .
INFJ	Do you want to know who you are ? Do n't ask . Act ! Action will delineate and define you .
ENTP	By failing to prepare , you are preparing to fail .
INTP	You have to learn the rules of the game . And then you have to play better than anyone else .
INFJ	Determine never to be idle . No person will have occasion to complain of the want of time who never loses any . It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing .
ESFP	Things do not happen . Things are made to happen .
ENFP	The secret of getting ahead is getting started .
ENTP	Well done is better than well said .
ENTJ	Quality is not an act , it is a habit .
ESFP	Setting goals is the first step in turning the invisible into the visible .
ESTJ	You ca n't build a reputation on what you are going to do .
INFP	To know oneself , one should assert oneself .
ESTP	You need to overcome the tug of people against you as you reach for high goals .
INFJ	Do not weep do not wax indignant . Understand .
INFP	Film spectators are quiet vampires .
INFP	Am I a romantic ? I 've seen 'Wuthering Heights ' ten times . I 'm a romantic .
ENFP	Movies can and do have tremendous influence in shaping young lives in the realm of entertainment towards the ideals and objectives of normal adulthood .
ESTP	The length of a film should be directly related to the endurance of the human bladder .
ISTP	A film is - or should be - more like music than like fiction . It should be a progression of moods and feelings . The theme , what 's behind the emotion , the meaning , all that comes later .
ISTP	If my films do n't show a profit , I know I 'm doing something right .
ISFP	Everything makes me nervous - except making films .
INFP	It 's the movies that have really been running things in America ever since they were invented . They show you what to do , how to do it , when to do it , how to feel about it , and how to look how you feel about it .
ESTP	A good film is when the price of the dinner , the theatre admission and the babysitter were worth it .
ISFP	So , where 's the Cannes Film Festival being held this year ?
ESTP	A lot of movies are about life , mine are like a slice of cake .
INFP	Movies are like an expensive form of therapy for me .
ESTJ	Every great film should seem new every time you see it .
ENTP	Even if I set out to make a film about a fillet of sole , it would be about me .
ENFP	Everyone told me to pass on Speed because it was a 'bus movie . '
ESTJ	Most of us do not consciously look at movies .
ENFP	There 's an electrical thing about movies .
ESFP	My skin is hard when it comes to my music . But with my movies , I 'm still a virgin in a lot of ways . I 'm not used to being shot down for no reason .
ESFP	I think with movies I am really connecting to the Joseph Campbell idea of the collective unconscious .
INFP	Over the years all these vampire movies have come out and nobody looks like a vampire anymore .
INTJ	One of my movies was called 'True Lies . ' It 's what the Democrats should have called their convention .
INTJ	I was striving to be the most muscular man , and it got me into the movies . It got me everything that I have .
ESFP	To me , movies and music go hand in hand . When I 'm writing a script , one of the first things I do is find the music I 'm going to play for the opening sequence .
ESTJ	By going to the movies , and because of other things , too , going to college , making a wide variety of friends , moving around traveling , I became a lot more open-minded than the heritage I was born into might have suggested .
ESFP	I wanted to do another movie that could make us laugh and cry and feel good about the world . I wanted to do something else that could make us smile . This is a time when we need to smile more and Hollywood movies are supposed to do that for people in difficult times .
ESFP	Movies are not about the weekend that they 're released , and in the grand scheme of things , that 's probably the most unimportant time of a film 's life .
ESFP	I 'm not a Hollywood basher because enough good movies come out of the Hollywood system every year to justify its existence , without any apologies .
ESFP	Movies are my religion and God is my patron . I 'm lucky enough to be in the position where I do n't make movies to pay for my pool . When I make a movie , I want it to be everything to me like I would die for it .
ESFP	If you just love movies enough , you can make a good one .
ESFP	All my movies are achingly personal .
ESFP	I have loved movies as the number one thing in my life so long that I ca n't ever remember a time when I did n't .
ESFP	I just grew up watching a lot of movies . I 'm attracted to this genre and that genre , this type of story , and that type of story . As I watch movies I make some version of it in my head that is n't quite what I 'm seeing - taking the things I like and mixing them with stuff I 've never seen before .
ESFP	I do n't really have a schedule of when I want to show my children my movies .
ISTP	Sexiness , particularly in movies , is the chess game in the 'Thomas Crown Affair ' . It 's , it 's , I do n't know , but Faye Dunaway comes up a lot in that thinking . It 's the subtlety of sexiness . The moment you try to be sexy , then it 's not .
ENFP	I have been pregnant in so many movies it 's ridiculous .
ENFP	There are a lot of movies that are unbelievable successes that I would be mortified to be a part of .
ENTP	I can be in 20 movies . But I 'll never be an actor .
INFP	Sex is a doorway to something so powerful and mystical , but movies usually depict it in a completely flat way .
ENFJ	Not only do I have to live , right , I have to get some cash for my troubles - it 's a scary thing , and people need to start to think about the messages that they send in the movies .
ESFP	Everyone related to me in my circle was from church : church friends , church school , church activities . All my friends were n't allowed to watch MTV or go to PG-13 movies or listen to the radio , so I did n't really know anything different . That 's how I was raised .
ESFJ	I 'm doing 'Les Miserables , ' the movie . I 've done a lot of musicals and a lot of movies , and I know there are not a lot of people in Hollywood who have been down those two paths so I 've been like , 'Come on , let 's do a movie/musical . '
ESFJ	I have done many movies that people had n't seen . 'The Fountain , ' I spent a year on that . 'The Prestige ' with Chris Nolan , and 'Australia . ' From my perspective it 's very satisfying . Some movies people see and other movies they do n't . 'Wolverine , ' 'X Men , ' I know that in some level people know me just for that and it 's fine for me .
INFP	I do n't know what it was , maybe the movie theaters in my immediate surrounding neighbourhood in Burbank , but I never saw what would be considered A movies .
INFP	I never really got nightmares from movies . In fact , I recall my father saying when I was three years old that I would be scared , but I never was .
ISTP	Even the worst Bond movies , there 's something to love about them .
INFJ	I see a lot of movies . I love films as a spectator , and that 's never obscured by the part of me that does the work myself . I just love going to the movies .
INTJ	My children have never watched any of my films . Charlie knows that daddy makes movies , but he says they are not good enough for him to watch .
ESTP	I still like the run and gun action movies and how truly dangerous it can be to make these films .
ESTP	Frankly , I got into the movies because I like the movies a lot .
ISTP	Sure , 'Twilight ' is really huge right now and everybody 's freaking out over it , but it will go away soon and I will be back to doing what I 'm used to doing : weird little movies that nobody sees .
ESTP	I have a very busy life , and not many people who have a career and four kids go out a lot to the movies .
ESTP	I think that 's what distinguishes Schmidt , really . In the movies now , so much of what is appealing to an audience is the dramatic or has to do with science fiction , and Schmidt is simply human . There 's no melodrama there 's no device , It 's just about a human being .
INFP	And what I like about it is it makes me happy and I think it makes a lot of people happy to go to the movies and to not think about the problems of the day or the problems of tomorrow or the yesterday and just go on for the ride and have the fun of losing oneself in a fantasy .
ESFP	I was n't allowed to go to movies when I was kid my father was a minister . 101 Dalmatians and King of Kings , that was the extent of it .
ISTP	I do n't want to make movies for kids , and I do n't want to make movies for adults either .
ISFJ	Well , everyone likes movies when they 're a little kid .
ISTJ	I played Winnie Cooper on 'The Wonder Years ' from ages 12-18 , and did a few other movies during some of the summers .
ISTJ	I used to love to go to the movies - I 'd see two in a row . A few times I even snuck into the second movie after it started ... now that I think about it , that 's kind of like shoplifting ! Needless to say , I still love going to the movies , but I do n't sneak in anymore .
ENFJ	Most of the time it 's the role . Sometimes it 's the story and sometimes it just the paycheck . It 's the little movies that come out as stories or the fact that I have work to go out , you know what I 'm saying , you can only be out so long without work , you start getting antsy .
ENFJ	It can have an enormous effect because big budget movies can have big budget perks , and small budget movies have no perks , but what is the driving force , of course , is the script , and your part in it .
ENFJ	People need to start to think about the messages that they send in the movies .
ENTP	I do not quote my own movies . I think I would be pretty insufferable if I did .
ENTP	People do n't have these tidy little redemption arcs in reality the way they do in movies .
ENTP	I 'm not an especially highbrow person , but I have always loved small , quirky , edgy movies .
ENTP	I do n't know why , but I 've always been a sucker for roller coasters in movies .
ISTP	It 's not like I sit around watching my movies again and again , but I 've never quite believed actors when they say they do n't watch themselves .
ESTP	The reason I chose the movies that I did was based on where they were being filmed .
ESFJ	I wanted to be in Jim Carrey comedy movies before I met him . I wanted to be a comedian on Stage 19 , yukking it up .
ISTP	You 're creating new things in movies and people are going to steal them .
ISTP	When you 're making movies you 've got to get obsessive .
ISTP	I guess you could say I 've been in my share of violent movies .
ISTP	I was sick and tired of being an English actor who did a lot of American movies because I was cheap and good .
ISTP	I always wanted to make movies .
ISTP	If I wanted to make spy movies for the rest of my life , that would be one thing , but I do n't want to just make spy movies .
ESFP	I 'm not a film buff . I do n't watch a lot of movies .
ESFP	Growing up I did n't watch movies .
ISFP	I think we 're very complicated and we 're capable of all kinds of things , and movies do n't reflect that .
ISFP	I think it 's more interesting to see people who do n't feel appropriately . I relate to that , because sometimes I do n't feel anything at all for things I 'm supposed to , and other times I feel too much . It 's not always like it is in the movies .
ESTJ	We can now have action movies with two stars where one might be African American and one might be Asian American . One of them does n't have to be white , and the other one does n't have to be the ethnic sidekick . We 're way over that . And I think it 's happening in society , too .
ISFJ	I 've made movies that we 're very successful that we 're a complete surprise , and I 've made movies that I thought we 're going to be very successful that , you know .
ISFJ	My favorite characters are the ones that are the most successful movies .
ISFJ	I 've made three musical movies which is pretty good considering that not many are made but I was lucky in other ways . I came along when independent movies were starting to boom .
ISFJ	When videotape came so a lot of movies that I do have a kind of afterlife in video . Things where movies that I do would come and go they still come and go but you can go rent them and see them on TV .
ISFJ	I think if you do something effectively whether you 're the lover or the comic or the action guy or the villain like I play movies are very expensive to make . Chances are you 'll get asked to play that part again .
ISFJ	I have been in movies that I thought I was n't very good in .
ISFJ	I make movies that nobody will see . I 've made movies that even I have never seen .
ISFJ	I used to be prettier than I am , but I think I look better now . I was a pretty boy . Particularly in my early movies . I do n't like looking at them so much . There 's a sort of pretty thing about me .
ENTP	I aim for a lifetime full of movies .
ESTP	I do n't know why I do n't watch a lot of movies I can barely keep up with the things my friends are in . There is n't enough time in life .
ISTP	And being as I 'm somebody who loves movies like The Machinist , I also love going along to big mass entertainment movies . I get in the mood for all kinds of movies , and so I like to try each of them .
ISTP	In terms of the romantic kind of lead , I just never enjoy those movies very much . Maybe they 'll come to interest me more as I get older . I doubt it , but maybe . Romantic comedies tend to be , for me , an oxymoron .
ISTP	There are movies that require fantasy and slightly more fantastical acting . Lines that are good for certain movies , in real life circumstances , would be absolutely unbelievable things to really say , and you would look at these people like they 're freaks for conversing that way . But somehow for certain styles of movies , it works , and it seems fine .
ISTP	I like the idea of movies having a magic element . How many times have you seen an actor in a movie who you know only as the character ? It 's wonderful , is n't it ?
ISTP	I do n't get it when you get so much openness about the way movies are made , and the special effects and the behind-the-scenes stuff and all of that . I ca n't help but feel like this reduces it a little bit .
ISTP	I always leave that for other people to decide , because some of the things I consider to be disasters are some people 's favorite movies . And that 's what I like so much , is that you never know . Something intrigues somebody and means nothing to somebody else .
ISTJ	Where I live , nobody who 's fourteen is having sex and doing major drugs . And I think if you see it in the movies , you may be influenced by it . I think it 's so important to preserve your innocence .
ISTJ	There are movies where we are interested in seeing people 's lives without agreeing with what they 're doing .
ESFJ	I 've turned down twentysomething million dollars for movies .
INFP	When I started to watch some of the films I 'd done , I realized I was doing movies that I might not actually want to see .
ENFP	I just think old old movies , they make you concentrate and pay attention so much more . They feel so warm . A lot of modern digital videotape , it 's just too bright . Do n't know why , it 's not warm .
ISFP	Sundance is weird . The movies are weird - you actually have to think about them when you watch them .
INFP	I want to make all kinds of movies . I do want to make big movies that are a lot of fun to go to , but I also want to make movies that are going to stimulate some thought and maybe raise some awareness .
INFP	I do like to move and get physical in my movies .
INFP	I 'm an enormous admirer of Christopher Lee . He 's somebody , along with Vincent Price , who I celebrate , and I wanted my movies to show that celebration and that honoring of these great film stars that were unafraid to go into horror and Grand Guignol and the macabre .
INFP	I have eclectic tastes in the movies I want to do .
INFP	I do n't want to just do independent movies and I do n't want to just do adventure films . I enjoy both , and I think both are cogent .
INFP	I 'm the first to admit that I like going to , or my memories at least of going to Clint Eastwood movies or Charles Bronson or James Bond .
INFP	I like fantasy . I like horror , science fiction because I can get avant-garde with those performances in those movies .
INFP	I care about the connection with the audience . Film is such a powerful medium . Movies can change the way people think .
INFP	I do enjoy animated movies .
ESFP	You do n't want to be photographed ? You do n't want to be known ? Then you do n't need to be out there peddling movies .
ESFP	I have n't deliberately set out to play the blonde bombshell in my movies . In fact , it 's probably been quite the opposite . After the success of The Mask , I was n't offered all that many blonde bombshell parts , to be honest . I think people believed from the beginning that I could actually walk and talk at the same time .
INTJ	I want to make movies that pierce people 's hearts and touch them in some way , even if it 's just for the night while they 're in the cinema in that moment , I want to bring actual tears to their eyes and goosebumps to their skin .
INFJ	People wrestle sometimes making movies , and I think that conflict is a very essential thing . I think a lot of very happy productions have produced a lot of very banal movies .
INFJ	I like making movies for myself and my friends and people with my sensibility .
INFJ	I just love movies .
INFP	There 's this index that tallies up how much your movies have made , and if they have n't grossed a certain amount , then you 're not bankable . I know I 'm not Will Smith but , you know , my ranking 's pretty low . The only studio picture I 've done is 'Zodiac , ' and that did n't perform that well .
INFP	I could n't survive just doing independent movies . And I 'd rather do modelling than movies or TV I did n't like .
ESFP	I did n't know what types of movies I wanted to do . I want to do things that are different . I want to take my time with each role .
ESFP	I just want to keep doing what I 'm doing and hopefully people will watch my movies .
ESFP	I grew up when I was 15 when I had my first opportunity in movies . I watched every great movie for a year and a half , and since then I 've asked myself how I can emulate such artistry . That 's really my motivation . I want to do something as good as my heroes have done .
ENFP	I loved old black and white movies , especially the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers musicals . I loved everything about them - the songs , the music , the romance and the spectacle . They were real class and I knew that I wanted to be in that world .
ESTJ	A lot of people just go to movies that feed into their preexisting and not so noble needs and desires : They just go to action pictures , and things like that .
ESTJ	Class is often invisible in America in the movies , and usually not the subject of the film .
ESTJ	Movies absorb our attention more completely , I think .
ESTJ	The movies that are made more thoughtfully or made or with more ambition often get just get drowned out by the noise .
ENTJ	I was watching 'Up In The Air ' and I thought , 'Jesus , who 's the old gray-haired guy ? ' And it was me . I never wear makeup for movies and now it 's starting to show .
ESFJ	My passion is doing movies , and as long as I keep doing that , I 'll be happy . I want to do movies , fun roles and dramatic ones . I love all of it .
ESFJ	My passion is doing movies , so as long as I keep doing that I will be happy .
ISTJ	I 'm fed up with the idiots ... the ever-widening gap between people who know how to make movies and the people who green-light the movies .
ENTJ	I grew up on Bette Davis movies , and Marlene Dietrich , Marilyn Monroe .
ISFJ	You have to get the audience invested even if you 're doing something that they think is dumb , it 's kind of what these movies are all about .
ISFJ	If you really want to be competitive in today 's market you have to be in movies that make money .
ISFJ	And you also have to do movies that are about commerce because that 's what is required of the industry today .
INFP	Usually when you see females in movies , they feel like they have these metallic structures around them , they are caged in by male energy .
ISTP	I think what a lot of action movies lose these days , especially the ones that deal with fantasy , is you stop caring at some point because you 've lost human scale .
ISTP	With the CGI , suddenly there 's a thousand enemies instead of six - the army goes off into the horizon . You do n't need that . The audience loses its relationship with the threat on the screen . That 's something that 's consistently happening and it makes these movies like video games and that 's a soulless enterprise . It 's all kinetics without emotion .
ESTP	Yes , I 'm going to be the President of the United States . You know why ? You think you can get chicks by being in the movies ? You can really get chicks by being the President .
ESTP	I kinda see my current position like this : Here 's your five minutes in the toy store , so you got ta do all the good movies you can before 'Chuck Woolery ' rings the bell .
ESTP	The one benefit of having done all kinds of movies as an actor is , you learn the pros and cons of being tempted to do a really big movie because it costs a lot of money .
ESTP	You 're basically the sum of all the experiences you 've ever had , and they 're sort of shaken up in you and reproduced in the things you create , and that includes seeing movies .
ESTP	Not that it entirely matters : There is a perception that all actors make their movies . A lot of people assume you 're responsible . George Clooney told me actors get all of the blame and all the credit .
ESTP	My movies are unadorned , they 're not particularly fancy , I think they 're kind of workmanlike in some ways , focusing on the writing and the acting .
ESTP	I knew I had to get out of Boston and stop making movies there , at least for one movie , otherwise no one would ever consider me for a movie that took place south of Providence .
ESTP	I 've never held myself up particularly high when I had movies that worked , and I never held myself all that low when I had failures .
ESFJ	I always , always meant to be on stage . I only ended up even auditioning for television and movies because I was understudying a Turgenev play on Broadway and was so broke that , when I got a mini-series , I had to take it and was so ashamed because I was such a snob .
ISFP	I was influenced when I was younger by the cartoon movies that Disney put out , like Cinderella and what not . I watched those movies over and over when I was younger and the music is ingrained into my head . Nowadays , I 'm still humming the tunes . It taught me the fundamentals .
ISFP	I like simple things . I like to sneak in the theatre and watch movies . I 'm a movie buff .
ISFP	If I did any movies I 'd have to take a break from singing , because I 'd want it to be really good .
ENFJ	I could n't be happier about being a part of 'Hunger Games ' and to play Katniss . I have a huge responsibility to the fans of this incredible book and I do n't take it lightly . I will give everything I have to these movies and to this role to make it worthy of Suzanne Collins ' masterpiece .
ENFJ	I never think it 's right to chew gum in front of other people , but a lot of times I 'll come in for a meeting chewing gum and I 'll forget I 'm chewing it . Then you do n't want to swallow it because it stays in your system for seven years or something , so I 've asked to throw it away . I 've started to wonder if that 's why I did n't get certain movies .
ENFP	I do believe that movies are subject to a million interpretations .
ENFP	I loved the movies and I wanted to be like Marilyn Monroe . I thought she was so glamorous and everyone seemed to love her . I wanted to be like that and I told everyone I would be the next Marilyn Monroe .
INFJ	I like movies that are about real people in real time with real problems .
INFJ	I learned a lesson which I did n't heed : Do n't put yourself in your movies . It 's too much .
INFJ	I went through this very serious Woody Allen phase in college and a little bit after college . I still see his movies .
INFJ	I actually have a thing about proper nouns . They clang on my ear in a weird way when I hear them dropped into movies .
INFJ	When I go to movies and I love the movie , it 's because it feels like it articulated something about how we 're living now , and also gives me some insight into my own life . I feel actually altered after having seen it .
INFJ	A lot of times , we 're just sold these movies that are really cynically conceived and marketed , and they just want you there opening weekend , before everybody finds out it 's not so good .
INTJ	I did n't have any ambition to produce big mainstream popcorn movies .
ENFP	All through my life what I 've loved doing is watching movies . I love the escapism of film , I love stories . So it is incredible to be able to be in them as much as I am , to see them from the first stitch in a costume to the end product .
ISTP	I filmed seven movies in 2011 and I think that was a mistake . I pushed myself too hard and I want to be able to come to work each day and give 100 percent . I guess I found out what my boundaries are .
ISTP	I 'm into 'The Walking Dead , ' 'Shaun of the Dead , ' obviously , and I 've seen all the Romero movies . I am a classic zombie queen . And I love the White Walkers on 'Game of Thrones . ' Weirdly , it was n't until pretty late in life that I found my entry point into horror films .
INFJ	For a number of years , I 'd been around the kind of people who financed movies and the kind of people who are there to make the deals for movies . But I 'd always had this naive idea that everybody wants to make movies as good as they can be , which is stupid .
ISTJ	I do n't like to watch my own movies - I fall asleep in my own movies .
ISTJ	Movies are hard work . The public does n't see that . The critics do n't see it . But they 're a lot of work . A lot of work .
ISTJ	I 'll work with a director if I think I 'm going to get into a comfortable situation , and if it 's someone I respect and who respects me , even if they 're not so well known . Movies are hard to make , and you have to work toward a common ethic and do your best .
ENFP	Coming Home had been made before and Apocalypse Now and Deer Hunter , different kinds of movies .
ENFP	I 'm terrible at horror movies , by the way . I get scared so easily .
ENFP	One of the joys of going to the movies was that it was trashy , and we should never lose that .
INTJ	I do n't know if I see myself as really an action hero , but I like doing physical movies and I like doing movies where the writing is very lean .
INTJ	I love European movies and I kind of grew up on European films .
ISFJ	If I have to produce movies , direct movies , whatever to change the way Hollywood treats older women , I 'll do it . If I have to bend the rules , I will . If I have to break them , I will .
INTJ	I 've always had this idea that I wanted movies to make people better not worse .
INTJ	So , yes , there 's nothing I love more than listening to directors talk about their movies .
INTJ	The movies I made when I was 14 or 15 , I have a hard time looking at those . Those were the awkward years . I do n't know if anybody can look at something they did when they were 14 and not wince .
ENFP	Well , the thing about great fictional characters from literature , and the reason that they 're constantly turned into characters in movies , is that they completely speak to what makes people human .
ENFP	I did n't know this about myself , but when 'Pirates of the Caribbean ' came out I realised that I did n't enjoy a huge amount of recognition . I did n't react to it well , but I think life is about finding out who you are and what you like . So I started doing independent movies and art-house films instead .
ESTJ	Books and movies are different art forms with different rules . And because of that , they never translate exactly .
INFJ	I worked so hard for so long - I did a lot of movies . I also worked a lot when my kids were smaller , before they were in school .
INFJ	There 's always an imbalance with actors and actresses in the industry . And I think because there are just fewer movies overall being made , it 's that trickle down effect .
ENTP	When I finally got up to Industrial Light And Magic to work on the 'Star Wars ' movies as a model-maker , it felt like dying and going to heaven .
INTP	But when you 're writing a script - for me anyway - you have to sort of create an enforced innocence . You have to divest yourself of worrying about a lot of stuff like what movies are hot , what movies are not hot , what the budget of this movie might be .
INTP	Of course for many years directors have had to go on the road with their movies and promote them and I 've done that since the beginning . So that 's not new but the forms of it are different such as with the internet .
ISFP	Whenever I think about movies , I always look at that art process as having the best of a lot of worlds . Because if you watch a great film , you have a musical element to it , not just on the scoring , but in the way that the shots are edited - that has music and rhythm and time .
INTP	The more unique your film is and unusual it is and difficult it is , the harder it is to get it financed . That 's why a lot of good filmmakers are doing television . They do HBO movies .
ENFP	My favorite movies are movies that I go in and I leave deeply affected . Whether I laugh really hard or whether I cry really hard , I just want to feel really affected in that moment .
ENFP	I like to think of myself as a fairly educated human being , but I 'm a very uneducated actor when it comes to movies , directors , producers , actors for that matter .
ISTJ	I never wanted to do the same kind of movies over and over anyway , so my theory on it all is I 'm just gon na try and dodge the label and keep doing what I am doing .
ISTJ	Success is not something I 've wrapped my brain around . If people go to those movies , then yes , that 's true , big-time success . If not , it 's much ado about nothing .
ISTJ	If your movies do n't perform , they just stop calling you .
ISTJ	That 's the way this business works : if your movies do well at the box office , you will be offered more movies . It does n't matter if you 're a nice guy or you 're a prick . If your movies do well , there 's a job waiting for you in Hollywood . It 's not any more complicated than that .
ENFJ	When I 'm shooting a movie , I 'm always in an invisible theater seat . I respect the fact that people have worked hard all week and want to go to the movies on the weekend and be entertained .
ESFJ	It 's hard to incorporate dance into movies I think .
ESFJ	I love the old Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly movies they 're so beautiful to look at . It 's such a shame we do n't make them anymore . Although , I do n't know how you could make tap dancing current and topical .
INFP	I usually do get the tomboy parts in the movies , which is kind of like me , but not totally . I like to shop as much as Ashley , but she is a little more of a girlie-girl than me .
INFP	Blessed are the hearts that can bend they shall never be broken .
ENFJ	Forget the past .
ISFP	I must be careful not to get trapped in the past . That 's why I tend to forget my songs .
ISFP	Music does n't lie . If there is something to be changed in this world , then it can only happen through music .
ENFP	After silence , that which comes nearest to expressing the inexpressible is music .
INFP	Music is everybody 's possession . It 's only publishers who think that people own it .
ISFP	Music is my religion .
INTJ	In music the passions enjoy themselves .
ENTJ	I do n't make music for eyes . I make music for ears .
ISTP	Music , in performance , is a type of sculpture . The air in the performance is sculpted into something .
INFJ	Music is the strongest form of magic .
INFP	Where words fail , music speaks .
ENTP	The iPod completely changed the way people approach music .
INTP	He who joyfully marches to music in rank and file has already earned my contempt . He has been given a large brain by mistake , since for him the spinal cord would suffice .
ISFJ	The sexual embrace can only be compared with music and with prayer .
INFP	The man that hath no music in himself , Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds , is fit for treasons , stratagems and spoils .
INFP	Music inflames temperament .
ISFP	Sometimes I feel like rap music is almost the key to stopping racism .
ISFP	Music is a safe kind of high .
ISFP	If people take anything from my music , it should be motivation to know that anything is possible as long as you keep working at it and do n't back down .
ISFP	When I die , I want people to play my music , go wild and freak out and do anything they want to do .
ISFP	This land is your land and this land is my land , sure , but the world is run by those that never listen to music anyway .
ISFP	Music is so therapeutic for me that if I ca n't get it out , I start feeling bad about myself - a lot of self-loathing .
ISFP	I 've accomplished enough with the music that I have n't had to go out there and do other things to over-saturate .
ISTP	Without music to decorate it , time is just a bunch of boring production deadlines or dates by which bills must be paid .
ISFP	I try to use my music to move these people to act .
ISFP	The reflection of the world is blues , that 's where that part of the music is at . Then you got this other kind of music that 's tryin ' to come around .
ISTP	It is piracy , not overt online music stores , which is our main competitor .
INTJ	My heart , which is so full to overflowing , has often been solaced and refreshed by music when sick and weary .
ISFP	Music makes me high on stage , and that 's the truth . It 's like being almost addicted to music .
ISFP	People today are still living off the table scraps of the sixties . They are still being passed around - the music and the ideas .
ISFP	Here 's the thing with me and the religious thing . This is the flat-out truth : I find the religiosity and philosophy in the music . I do n't find it anywhere else .
ISFP	I became interested in folk music because I had to make it somehow .
ISFP	Folk music is a bunch of fat people .
ISFP	You ca n't imagine parlor ballads drifting out of high-rise multi-towered buildings . That kind of music existed in a more timeless state of life .
ISFP	Look , when I started out , mainstream culture was Sinatra , Perry Como , Andy Williams , Sound of Music . There was no fitting into it then and of course , there 's no fitting into it now .
ISFP	If you do n't know the blues ... there 's no point in picking up the guitar and playing rock and roll or any other form of popular music .
ISTP	Most people would n't know music if it came up and bit them on the ass .
ISTP	My mother knew how to read music and everything . But I just kinda learned off of records . And so , I was listening to records and I 'd play 'em over and over .
ENTJ	Music is the voice that tells us that the human race is greater than it knows .
ENTJ	I like having my hair and face done , but I 'm not going to lose weight because someone tells me to . I make music to be a musician not to be on the cover of Playboy .
ESFP	Music for me , it demands full concentration .
INFP	Poetry fettered , fetters the human race . Nations are destroyed or flourish in proportion as their poetry , painting , and music are destroyed or flourish .
ISTP	Music is always a commentary on society .
INTJ	I enjoy all forms of music - pop , classical and opera .
ISFP	I want my fans to love themselves . It 's almost like I want to hypnotize them so when they hear my music they love themselves instantly .
ESFJ	Music has healing power . It has the ability to take people out of themselves for a few hours .
ISFP	Rock and Roll : Music for the neck downwards .
ISFP	On the other hand , what I like my music to do to me is awaken the ghosts inside of me . Not the demons , you understand , but the ghosts .
ENFJ	When I was a teenager , I began to settle into school because I 'd discovered the extracurricular activities that interested me : music and theater .
ISFP	I came into music just because I wanted the bread . It 's true . I looked around and this seemed like the only way I was going to get the kind of bread I wanted .
ISFP	Nothing pleases me more than to go into a room and come out with a piece of music .
ENFP	I get bored easily , so I need to do a lot . I 've started a record label , so I get to nurture new talent and talk about music , which is a passion of mine . I 've written another book . And I get to come to work and do the TV show , which is always really fun .
ESFP	I 'm a big collector of vinyl - I have a record room in my house - and I 've always had a huge soundtrack album collection . So what I do , as I 'm writing a movie , is go through all those songs , trying to find good songs for fights , or good pieces of music to layer into the film .
ISFP	I had to resign myself , many years ago , that I 'm not too articulate when it comes to explaining how I feel about things . But my music does it for me , it really does .
INFJ	I decided to make music again at a time when I could n't have had more obstacles .
INFJ	What I know is my music gets blamed for school shootings .
ISFP	The only things Mick and I disagree about is the band , the music and what we do .
ISFP	I felt I really wanted to back off from music completely and just work within the visual arts in some way . I started painting quite passionately at that time .
ISFP	I think what made it difficult for people to get , and still makes it difficult for people to get , is the theatrical nature of the work and the fact that , my music does n't exist without the performance-art element .
ESTP	People have n't always been there for me , but music always has .
ESFP	I think older people can appreciate my music because I really show my heart when I sing , and it 's not corny . I think I can grow as an artist , and my fans will grow with me .
ISFP	It was Elvis who really got me hooked on beat music . When I heard 'Heartbreak Hotel ' I thought , this is it .
ISFP	Music itself is going to become like running water or electricity . So it 's like , just take advantage of these last few years because none of this is ever going to happen again . You 'd better be prepared for doing a lot of touring because that 's really the only unique situation that 's going to be left .
INFP	I think the most important thing about music is the sense of escape .
ISFP	I dropped out of NYU , moved out of my parent 's house , got my own place , and survived on my own . I made music and worked my way from the bottom up .
ISFP	I wanted to prove the sustaining power of music .
ISFP	I do n't profess to have music as my big wheel and there are a number of other things as important to me apart from music . Theatre and mime , for instance .
ISFP	The absolute transformation of everything that we ever thought about music will take place within 10 years , and nothing is going to be able to stop it . I see absolutely no point in pretending that it 's not going to happen . I 'm fully confident that copyright , for instance , will no longer exist in 10 years .
ESTP	I would love to continue in music , with writing ... but I am not the kind of person who will hang around if I start to become irrelevant . If that happens , I will bow down gracefully , raise my kids , and have a garden . And I am going to let my hair go gray when I am older . I do n't need to be blonde when I 'm 60 !
ESTP	I think I first realized I wanted to be in country music and be an artist when I was 10 . And I started dragging my parents to festivals , and fairs , and karaoke contests , and I did that for about a year before I came to Nashville for the first time . I was 11 and I had this demo CD of me singing Dixie Chicks and Leanne Rimes songs .
INFJ	I 'll give up this sort of touring madness certainly , but music-everything is based on music . No , I 'll never stop my music .
ISFP	Pop music will never be low brow .
ISFP	Unless I am both capable of and willing to reopen the wound every time I write a song , if I choose to not look inside myself to write music , I 'm really not worth being called an artist at all .
ISFP	I write music every day .
ISFP	I do n't want to make niche-oriented music .
ISFP	I just want to keep writing music .
ISFP	You know , the BBC had not been particularly generous in its deliverance of blues and esoteric kinds of music .
ESTP	Music is my shining light , my favorite thing in the world . T get me to stop doing it for one second would be difficult !
ESTP	For me , great music does n't just have to fall into one category or one genre and I love appreciating all kinds of music .
ISFP	Inspiration for my music just comes from , you know , my life experiences .
ENTP	Music is a great energizer . It 's a language everybody knows .
ESTP	I do n't think I 'd ever make an album of just covers because I love writing my own music .
ISFP	You used to have to sing and convey emotion , and now , well , technically you can do anything with technology . It sucks for music today , but that 's why that old music feels so good to me .
ESFJ	As a boy , I 'd always had an interest in theater . But the idea at my school was that drama and music were to round out the man . It was n't what one did for a living . I got over that .
ENFP	I think one of my favorite things to do is just lock myself up in a small room and listen to music and watch films for a day . Also I just like seeing my friends . We have pizza parties which means I get four friends round , we eat a pizza and we 're really lazy and we play PlayStation .
ISFP	For me the visual is just as important as the music .
INFJ	Music is the emotional life of most people .
ESFP	I do n't care what people say about my relationship I do n't care what they say about my boobs . People are buying my songs I have a sold-out tour . I 'm getting incredible feedback from my music .
ISFP	Pop is actually my least favorite kind of music , because it lacks real depth .
INFP	I 've had to keep exploring different ways of presenting the music so I do n't repeat myself .
INFP	People listen to music the way they want to listen to music .
INFP	I do n't see music as working .
INFP	My father was a minister and so rock music was banned in our house .
INFP	This was a time frame when dance music and clubs were having a real impact on culture , and it had an impact on me .
INFP	Music is always a reflection of what 's going on in the hearts and minds of the culture .
ENFP	I dabbled in things like Howlin ' Wolf , Cream and Led Zeppelin , but when I heard Son House and Robert Johnson , it blew my mind . It was something I 'd been missing my whole life . That music made me discard everything else and just get down to the soul and honesty of the blues .
ESFJ	I love music .
ESFP	If you like my music , great , and if you do n't , whatever . I 'm going to keep making it either way .
ESFP	Oh , I will always be honest with my music . The records are black boxes for me . Like if you want to know who I am , my views , my perspective , things I love , things I hate , my convictions , my anthems . I 've never let people 's opinions affect the way I write .
INFJ	We used to play music for fun . Much more than now . Now nobody picks up a guitar unless they 're paid for it .
INFJ	It is so characteristic , that just when the mechanics of reproduction are so vastly improved , there are fewer and fewer people who know how the music should be played .
ENTP	What I like about music is the songs you can remember the lines of in a single second .
ENTP	Music is part of the life of fashion , too .
ESFJ	The only reason that you do visual is solely for the visual . That 's the only reason . It does n't sell your music for you .
ESFJ	Without a doubt , the best way to get to know me is through my music .
ESFJ	Country music is still your grandpa 's music , but it 's also your daughter 's music . It 's getting bigger and better all the time and I 'm glad to be a part of it .
ESFJ	Music is a great natural high and a great natural escape .
ESFJ	Marilyn Monroe never sold a platinum album . And more people know my music than what I look like .
ESFJ	My music must reflect whatever 's going on in my mind , and my life needs to evolve for me to discover who it is I 'm becoming .
ENFJ	Every so often , I feel I should graduate to classical music , properly . But the truth is , I 'm more likely to listen to rock music .
ISTP	For me , music and life are all about style .
INFP	Maybe someday you can accuse somebody of being a poseur by selling out and playing blues music , but that 's just not going to happen in my lifetime .
ENTJ	I have n't heard any music on the BBC World Service in a long time . Maybe I 'm listening at the wrong times . But not one single piece of music .
ESTP	Music is the language of the heart , and conservatives always screw it up .
ISTJ	My husband is a composer , so he plays piano all the time and I sit there and clap telling my unborn child , 'Hear me clap , hear the music . ' I know music , in general , is supposed to be good for babies to hear .
ENFJ	I think ABBA have a pure joy to their music and that 's what makes them extraordinary .
ENFJ	The great moments of rock 'n ' roll were never off in some corner of the music world , in a self-constructed ghetto .
ENFJ	Rock music is niche .
INTJ	The basis of our partnership strategy and our partnership approach : We build the social technology . They provide the music .
ESFJ	Soul music is timeless .
INFP	There 's a constantly applicable nature to soul music , whereas sometimes pop music can be a periodical .
ISFJ	I 've been composing music all my life and if I 'd been clever enough at school I would like to have gone to music college .
INTJ	That 's why this generation is the least racist generation ever . You see it all the time . Go to any club . People are intermingling , hanging out , having fun , enjoying the same music . Hip-hop is not just in the Bronx anymore . It 's worldwide . Everywhere you go , people are listening to hip-hop and partying together . Hip-hop has done that .
ESTP	I do n't listen to a lot of new stuff . I just like the old stuff . It 's all quite dramatic and atmospheric . You 'd have an entire story in song . I never listen to , like , white music - I could n't sing you a Zeppelin or Floyd song .
ESTP	I listen to music that is of our time and I just get angry .
ENTP	Ah , reality TV : where opportunists delight in exposing opportunism ! It 's kind of like the indie music scene .
INFP	Hopefully people can see my music is tethered to my brain .
INFP	I 'm a good music provider , and I 'm fine with that . I 'm a quality music manufacturer .
INFP	I scientifically engineer my music to be as accessible as possible .
INFP	It 's almost charity work , what people have done , turning other people on to my music .
INFP	The way I feel about music is that there is no right and wrong . Only true and false .
INFP	I 've never believed that pop music is escapist trash . There 's always a darkness in it , even amidst great pop music .
INFP	Also , because people like to multitask , in a way if you 've got a bit of music on in the background and the lyrical content is making you want to listen to it , then that would probably put you off the texting you wanted to do . I think people like things that just make that right kind of noise , but leave your brain free to do something else .
ISFP	What 's missing from pop music is danger .
ISFJ	Music will always be my No . 1 passion , but I do n't have to be doing it professionally . It 's not really about that for me anymore . I feel like I do n't have to look at it as a career . I can just rest in it and just be .
ISFJ	When you grow up in the music industry , trying to be Britney Spears because that 's what sells records and then you realize , 'All I have to do is be myself ? I should have thought of that a long time ago , ' it feels good to have success come from what 's actually inside of you .
INFP	Hearing my songs in public freaks me out a bit . There was one restaurant I really liked in L.A. , but I had to stop going there when they started playing my music . It felt kinda awkward .
INFJ	One and the same thing can at the same time be good , bad , and indifferent , e.g. , music is good to the melancholy , bad to those who mourn , and neither good nor bad to the deaf .
ENFP	And the day came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom .
INTP	Look deep into nature , and then you will understand everything better .
ESTP	One of the most tragic things I know about human nature is that all of us tend to put off living . We are all dreaming of some magical rose garden over the horizon instead of enjoying the roses that are blooming outside our windows today .
INFP	In the depth of winter I finally learned that there was in me an invincible summer .
ESTP	Solitary trees , if they grow at all , grow strong .
INFP	One touch of nature makes the whole world kin .
INFP	Autumn is a second spring when every leaf is a flower .
ENTJ	In all things of nature there is something of the marvelous .
ENTJ	If one way be better than another , that you may be sure is nature 's way .
ENTJ	If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch , you must first invent the universe .
ENFP	Spring is nature 's way of saying , 'Let 's party ! '
INTJ	For in the true nature of things , if we rightly consider , every green tree is far more glorious than if it were made of gold and silver .
ISTP	I am two with nature .
INTP	To sit in the shade on a fine day and look upon verdure is the most perfect refreshment .
INTJ	Nature is wont to hide herself .
INFJ	A strong body makes the mind strong . As to the species of exercises , I advise the gun . While this gives moderate exercise to the body , it gives boldness , enterprise and independence to the mind . Games played with the ball , and others of that nature , are too violent for the body and stamp no character on the mind . Let your gun therefore be your constant companion of your walks .
INTP	Joy in looking and comprehending is nature 's most beautiful gift .
INTP	We still do not know one thousandth of one percent of what nature has revealed to us .
INTP	Occurrences in this domain are beyond the reach of exact prediction because of the variety of factors in operation , not because of any lack of order in nature .
INTP	It stands to the everlasting credit of science that by acting on the human mind it has overcome man 's insecurity before himself and before nature .
INFP	A peace is of the nature of a conquest for then both parties nobly are subdued , and neither party loser .
INFJ	Truth is by nature self-evident . As soon as you remove the cobwebs of ignorance that surround it , it shines clear .
ISFP	Sex is a part of nature . I go along with nature .
ENTJ	All human actions have one or more of these seven causes : chance , nature , compulsions , habit , reason , passion , desire .
INFJ	Man can never be a woman 's equal in the spirit of selfless service with which nature has endowed her .
INFP	Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time .
ENTP	In general , mankind , since the improvement of cookery , eats twice as much as nature requires .
INTJ	All the perplexities , confusion and distress in America arise , not from defects in their Constitution or Confederation , not from want of honor or virtue , so much as from the downright ignorance of the nature of coin , credit and circulation .
ENTJ	Man is by nature a political animal .
ENTJ	Nature does nothing in vain .
ENTJ	For as the eyes of bats are to the blaze of day , so is the reason in our soul to the things which are by nature most evident of all .
ENTJ	The moral virtues , then , are produced in us neither by nature nor against nature . Nature , indeed , prepares in us the ground for their reception , but their complete formation is the product of habit .
ENTJ	He who can be , and therefore is , another 's , and he who participates in reason enough to apprehend , but not to have , is a slave by nature .
ENTP	What is tolerance ? It is the consequence of humanity . We are all formed of frailty and error let us pardon reciprocally each other 's folly - that is the first law of nature .
INFP	Retaliation is related to nature and instinct , not to law . Law , by definition , can not obey the same rules as nature .
ISFP	My nature just changes .
ISFP	I was trying to do too many things at the same time , which is my nature . But I was enjoying it , and I still do enjoy it .
ENTP	We are all full of weakness and errors let us mutually pardon each other our follies - it is the first law of nature .
ISFP	I think I have a dualistic nature .
INFP	It is the nature of truth in general , as of some ores in particular , to be richest when most superficial .
ISTJ	Economic medicine that was previously meted out by the cupful has recently been dispensed by the barrel . These once unthinkable dosages will almost certainly bring on unwelcome after-effects . Their precise nature is anyone 's guess , though one likely consequence is an onslaught of inflation .
ENTP	When we think of the major threats to our national security , the first to come to mind are nuclear proliferation , rogue states and global terrorism . But another kind of threat lurks beyond our shores , one from nature , not humans - an avian flu pandemic .
ENFP	All cartoon characters and fables must be exaggeration , caricatures . It is the very nature of fantasy and fable .
ISFJ	Nothing happens to any man that he is not formed by nature to bear .
ENFP	You ca n't just let nature run wild .
ENFJ	The most beautiful as well as the most ugly inclinations of man are not part of a fixed biologically given human nature , but result from the social process which creates man .
ENFP	Consistency is contrary to nature , contrary to life . The only completely consistent people are dead .
ENTJ	The sacred rights of mankind are not to be rummaged for among old parchments or musty records . They are written , as with a sunbeam , in the whole volume of human nature , by the hand of the divinity itself and can never be erased .
ENTJ	There is a certain enthusiasm in liberty , that makes human nature rise above itself , in acts of bravery and heroism .
INTP	To feel much for others and little for ourselves to restrain our selfishness and exercise our benevolent affections , constitute the perfection of human nature .
ISTP	There are a lot of conservative people , a lot of moderate people , Republicans , Democrats , in Hollywood . It is just that the conservative people by the nature of the word itself play closer to the vest . They do not go around hot dogging it .
ESTP	We must lay hold of the fact that economic laws are not made by nature . They are made by human beings .
ENTP	To understand the nature of the people one must be a prince , and to understand the nature of the prince , one must be of the people .
ENTJ	In the general course of human nature , A power over a man 's subsistence amounts to a power over his will .
INFJ	It is wrong to think that the task of physics is to find out how Nature is . Physics concerns what we say about Nature .
ENTP	Nature that framed us of four elements , warring within our breasts for regiment , doth teach us all to have aspiring minds .
ISTP	Time is nature 's way of keeping everything from happening at once .
ISTJ	The psychical , whatever its nature may be , is itself unconscious .
ENTP	There is but one law for all , namely that law which governs all law , the law of our Creator , the law of humanity , justice , equity - the law of nature and of nations .
INTJ	To insult someone we call him 'bestial . For deliberate cruelty and nature , 'human ' might be the greater insult .
INTP	What a book a devil 's chaplain might write on the clumsy , wasteful , blundering , low , and horribly cruel work of nature !
ENTP	It is the nature of all greatness not to be exact .
INTP	Complex , statistically improbable things are by their nature more difficult to explain than simple , statistically probable things .
INTJ	Man is fully responsible for his nature and his choices .
INTJ	There are grounds for cautious optimism that we may now be near the end ofthe search for the ultimate laws of nature .
ISTJ	Men speak of natural rights , but I challenge any one to show where in nature any rights existed or were recognized until there was established for their declaration and protection a duly promulgated body of corresponding laws .
INFP	You can hold yourself back from the sufferings of the world , that is something you are free to do and it accords with your nature , but perhaps this very holding back is the one suffering you could avoid .
INFP	Nature never deceives us it is we who deceive ourselves .
INFP	It is the nature of the artist to mind excessively what is said about him . Literature is strewn with the wreckage of men who have minded beyond reason the opinions of others .
ESTP	Our ideas must be as broad as Nature if they are to interpret Nature .
ENFP	If people think nature is their friend , then they sure do n't need an enemy .
INTP	All my life through , the new sights of Nature made me rejoice like a child .
ESFP	It is the nature of babies to be in bliss .
INTP	They are much to be pitied who have not been given a taste for nature early in life .
INTP	Human nature is so well disposed towards those who are in interesting situations , that a young person , who either marries or dies , is sure of being kindly spoken of .
ENTJ	Airplane travel is nature 's way of making you look like your passport photo .
INFJ	I sit astride life like a bad rider on a horse . I only owe it to the horse 's good nature that I am not thrown off at this very moment .
ESTP	Nature has not got two voices , you know , one of them condemning all day what the other commands .
ENFJ	The science of the mind can only have for its proper goal the understanding of human nature by every human being , and through its use , brings peace to every human soul .
ENTP	What we observe is not nature itself , but nature exposed to our method of questioning .
ESTP	There is no God , Nature sufficeth unto herself in no wise hath she need of an author .
ENTJ	I have lived long enough to satisfy both nature and glory .
ESTP	Natural gas is hemispheric . I like to call it hemispheric in nature because it is a product that we can find in our neighborhoods .
ESTP	Destruction , hence , like creation , is one of Nature 's mandates .
ISFJ	It is good to realize that if love and peace can prevail on earth , and if we can teach our children to honor nature 's gifts , the joys and beauties of the outdoors will be here forever .
ESFJ	I am a leader by default , only because nature does not allow a vacuum .
ESTP	Look , when you 're the president , there 's all kinds of things said about us . I mean , it 's just the nature of the job .
ISTJ	The right of nature ... is the liberty each man hath to use his own power , as he will himself , for the preservation of his own nature that is to say , of his own life .
ISFP	I 'm definitely a Polaroid camera girl . For me , what I 'm really excited about is bringing back the artistry and the nature of Polaroid .
ISFP	The elusive nature of love ... it can be such a fleeting thing . You see it there and it 's just fluttering and it 's gone .
ENTP	The duty of man is the same in respect to his own nature as in respect to the nature of all other things , namely not to follow it but to amend it .
ISFP	I 'm experimental by nature ... always exploring my creativity .
ESFP	The willow is my favorite tree . I grew up near one . It 's the most flexible tree in nature and nothing can break it - no wind , no elements , it can bend and withstand anything .
INFP	I have resolved on an enterprise that has no precedent and will have no imitator . I want to set before my fellow human beings a man in every way true to nature and that man will be myself .
ESTP	All , all is theft , all is unceasing and rigorous competition in nature the desire to make off with the substance of others is the foremost - the most legitimate - passion nature has bred into us and , without doubt , the most agreeable one .
INTP	Resentment seems to have been given us by nature for a defense , and for a defense only ! It is the safeguard of justice and the security of innocence .
ENFP	A book is a fragile creature , it suffers the wear of time , it fears rodents , the elements and clumsy hands . so the librarian protects the books not only against mankind but also against nature and devotes his life to this war with the forces of oblivion .
ESTP	The primary and most beautiful of Nature 's qualities is motion , which agitates her at all times , but this motion is simply a perpetual consequence of crimes , she conserves it by means of crimes only .
ISFJ	I thoroughly enjoy getting away from the game and going out fishing because it 's so relaxing , so quiet and peaceful . I mean , there 's no noise other than nature - and it 's so different from what I do in a tournament situation that it just eases my mind .
ISFJ	We all dream . We dream vividly , depending on our nature . Our existence is beyond our explanation , whether we believe in God or we have religion or we 're atheist .
ENTP	I think the destructive , vicious , negative nature of much of the news media makes it harder to govern this country , harder to attract decent people to run for public office .
ENTP	There is a very remarkable inclination in human nature to bestow on external objects the same emotions which it observes in itself , and to find every where those ideas which are most present to it .
ESTP	Nature , who for the perfect maintenance of the laws of her general equilibrium , has sometimes need of vices and sometimes of virtues , inspires now this impulse , now that one , in accordance with what she requires .
ESFJ	By nature I 'm not a brooder .
ESFJ	That 's all about the natural order of things , the idea of nature protecting children but also children protecting nature .
ESFJ	I know I 'm not known as method . By nature I 'm not a brooder . What I continue to use is a mixture of the English school , which is traditionally outside-in , and the more American way of working from the inside out .
INFJ	Humans have certain properties and characteristics which are intrinsic to them , just as every other organism does . That 's human nature .
ENTP	Philosophy would render us entirely Pyrrhonian , were not nature too strong for it .
ENTP	Human Nature is the only science of man and yet has been hitherto the most neglected .
INFP	When I was growing up , Dr. Seuss was really my favorite . There was something about the lyrical nature and the simplicity of his work that really hit me .
INFP	It 's incredible how nature sets females up to take care of people , and yet it is tricky for them to take care of themselves .
INFP	The stars , that nature hung in heaven , and filled their lamps with everlasting oil , give due light to the misled and lonely traveller .
ENFP	If journalism is good , it is controversial , by its nature .
INFP	I used to be such a militant city-ist , but more and more I 've seen forests and nature and oceans , and I do n't know any more if this is the awesomest way to live .
INTP	Greed is a basic part of animal nature . Being against it is like being against breathing or eating . It means nothing .
INFJ	Whatsoever is contrary to nature is contrary to reason , and whatsoever is contrary to reason is absurd .
INFJ	Nothing in the universe is contingent , but all things are conditioned to exist and operate in a particular manner by the necessity of the divine nature .
INFP	Compared to America or Europe , God is n't a big part of our lives here . I do n't know anyone here who goes to church when he 's had a rough divorce or is going through depression . We go out into nature instead .
ENTP	People have always wanted to be recognized , and that 's human nature . But people used to want to be recognized for their accomplishments , and now they simply want to be visible .
ENTJ	Women , by their nature , are not exceptional chess players : they are not great fighters .
ISTJ	In the state of nature profit is the measure of right .
ISTP	When I get recognized for 'Twilight , ' it 's usually a teenage girl , and they 're usually really loud . So it certainly feels like I get recognized the most from that , but it could just be because of the nature of how vocal those fans are .
ISTP	I like figuring out where I need to be mentally so that I 'm not thinking about the camera and that it 's second nature . I want to get to a place where I can exist within the confines of what you can do with filmmaking and not have to think about it .
INFJ	Nothing exists from whose nature some effect does not follow .
ENTP	Natural science , does not simply describe and explain nature it is part of the interplay between nature and ourselves .
ESTJ	A child who is allowed to be disrespectful to his parents will not have true respect for anyone .
ISTJ	I can not think of any need in childhood as strong as the need for a father 's protection .
ESFP	Mothers all want their sons to grow up to be president , but they do n't want them to become politicians in the process .
ENTP	How pleasant it is for a father to sit at his child 's board . It is like an aged man reclining under the shadow of an oak which he has planted .
ESTP	The interesting thing about being a mother is that everyone wants pets , but no one but me cleans the kitty litter .
ENFJ	I feel very blessed to have two wonderful , healthy children who keep me completely grounded , sane and throw up on my shoes just before I go to an awards show just so I know to keep it real .
ENFP	Parenting is one of the hardest jobs on earth .
INFP	No , I 've never wanted kids . But I do read about parenting a lot .
INFP	How poor are they that have not patience ! What wound did ever heal but by degrees ?
INFP	Patience is bitter , but its fruit is sweet .
ENTP	Our patience will achieve more than our force .
ENTJ	I 'm extraordinarily patient provided I get my own way in the end .
INTJ	If I have done the public any service , it is due to my patient thought .
ENTP	He that can have patience can have what he will .
INFP	No , I will be the pattern of all patience I will say nothing .
ISFP	It is strange that the years teach us patience that the shorter our time , the greater our capacity for waiting .
ESTP	I think you can judge from somebody 's actions a kind of a stability and sense of purpose perhaps created by strong religious roots . I mean , there 's a certain patience , a certain discipline , I think , that religion helps you achieve .
ISFP	Honestly , I did n't have the patience for biology or history in an academic sense , but I always liked the kind of big questions .
ESTP	I 'm not really easy to live with ! There needs to be unlimited patience and unconditional love . Men I 've known before loved my independent spirit and were proud of my success , to the point that they 'd become jealous of the time I devote to my career .
INTP	Nationalism is an infantile disease . It is the measles of mankind .
ESFP	Let every nation know , whether it wishes us well or ill , that we shall pay any price , bear any burden , meet any hardship , support any friend , oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty .
ENFP	Patriot : the person who can holler the loudest without knowing what he is hollering about .
ENFP	Patriotism is the virtue of the vicious .
ESTP	You 're not supposed to be so blind with patriotism that you ca n't face reality . Wrong is wrong , no matter who says it .
ESTP	Each nation feels superior to other nations . That breeds patriotism - and wars .
ISTJ	Patriotism is easy to understand in America . It means looking out for yourself by looking out for your country .
ENTP	Patriotism is the willingness to kill and be killed for trivial reasons .
INFP	Patriotism is usually stronger than class hatred , and always stronger than internationalism .
ESTJ	Liberals become indignant when you question their patriotism , but simultaneously work overtime to give terrorists a cushion for the next attack and laugh at dumb Americans who love their country and hate the enemy .
ENTP	I do think the patriotic thing to do is to critique my country . How else do you make a country better but by pointing out its flaws ?
ENFJ	It is the patriotic duty of every man to lie for his country .
ISFP	Patriotism is an instant reaction that fades away when the war starts .
ENTP	The heights of popularity and patriotism are still the beaten road to power and tyranny .
INTP	Heroism on command , senseless violence , and all the loathsome nonsense that goes by the name of patriotism - how passionately I hate them !
ISTJ	Guard against the impostures of pretended patriotism .
ISFJ	Unfortunately , after Sept. 11 , there was an outburst in America of intense suffering and patriotism , and the Bush administration was very shrewd and effective in painting anyone who disagreed with the policies as unpatriotic or even traitorous .
ENTJ	I do n't want to see the military falling . I want to see the military rising to dignified heights of professionalism and true patriotism .
INFJ	An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind .
ISFJ	If we have no peace , it is because we have forgotten that we belong to each other .
ISFJ	Peace begins with a smile .
ESFP	Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable .

ENTP	He that would live in peace and at ease must not speak all he knows or all he sees .
ESFP	A people free to choose will always choose peace .
ESTP	Peace is a journey of a thousand miles and it must be taken one step at a time .
ENTP	Even peace may be purchased at too high a price .
INFJ	Peace is its own reward .
ESFP	It is an unfortunate fact that we can secure peace only by preparing for war .
ENFJ	Let there be work , bread , water and salt for all .
ENTJ	We make war that we may live in peace .
ENFJ	I dream of an Africa which is in peace with itself .
INFP	You can not find peace by avoiding life .
ENTJ	If they want peace , nations should avoid the pin-pricks that precede cannon shots .
INFJ	Peace is not an absence of war , it is a virtue , a state of mind , a disposition for benevolence , confidence , justice .
ISTJ	Peace and justice are two sides of the same coin .
ISTJ	Christmas is not a time nor a season , but a state of mind . To cherish peace and goodwill , to be plenteous in mercy , is to have the real spirit of Christmas .
INTP	Peace can not be kept by force it can only be achieved by understanding .
INTP	I am not only a pacifist but a militant pacifist . I am willing to fight for peace . Nothing will end war unless the people themselves refuse to go to war .
ISFJ	The greatest destroyer of peace is abortion because if a mother can kill her own child , what is left for me to kill you and you to kill me ? There is nothing between .
ENFJ	Peace is not merely a distant goal that we seek , but a means by which we arrive at that goal .
ENFJ	We must concentrate not merely on the negative expulsion of war but the postive affirmation of peace .
INTP	Avoid popularity if you would have peace .
ENTP	Be at war with your vices , at peace with your neighbors , and let every new year find you a better man .
ESFP	A mind at peace , a mind centered and not focused on harming others , is stronger than any physical force in the universe .
INFP	If everyone demanded peace instead of another television set , then there 'd be peace .
INFJ	Each one has to find his peace from within . And peace to be real must be unaffected by outside circumstances .
INFJ	If we are to teach real peace in this world , and if we are to carry on a real war against war , we shall have to begin with the children .
INFJ	Peace and abstinence from European interferences are our objects , and so will continue while the present order of things in America remain uninterrupted .
ISTJ	If we desire to avoid insult , we must be able to repel it if we desire to secure peace , one of the most powerful instruments of our rising prosperity , it must be known , that we are at all times ready for War .
INFP	All we are saying is give peace a chance .
ESFP	Peace is a daily , a weekly , a monthly process , gradually changing opinions , slowly eroding old barriers , quietly building new structures .
INFP	Our peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains .
ESFP	Peace is not absence of conflict , it is the ability to handle conflict by peaceful means .
ESFP	Let the word go forth from this time and place , to friend and foe alike , that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans - born in this century , tempered by war , disciplined by a hard and bitter peace .
ESFP	The world knows that America will never start a war . This generation of Americans has had enough of war and hate ... we want to build a world of peace where the weak are secure and the strong are just .
INFP	You either get tired fighting for peace , or you die .
INFP	When you make your peace with authority , you become authority .
ESTP	The soldier above all others prays for peace , for it is the soldier who must suffer and bear the deepest wounds and scars of war .
ISTJ	To be prepared for war is one of the most effective means of preserving peace .
ESTP	If civilization is to survive , we must cultivate the science of human relationships - the ability of all peoples , of all kinds , to live together , in the same world at peace .
ESTP	Wars are , of course , as a rule to be avoided but they are far better than certain kinds of peace .
ENFJ	Intervention only works when the people concerned seem to be keen for peace .
INTJ	Peace if possible , truth at all costs .
INTJ	The meaning of peace is the absence of opposition to socialism .
ISTP	I took a speed-reading course and read War and Peace in twenty minutes . It involves Russia .
INTJ	Peace is more important than all justice and peace was not made for the sake of justice , but justice for the sake of peace .
ESFJ	It is understanding that gives us an ability to have peace . When we understand the other fellow 's viewpoint , and he understands ours , then we can sit down and work out our differences .
ISTJ	I like to believe that people in the long run are going to do more to promote peace than our governments . Indeed , I think that people want peace so much that one of these days governments had better get out of the way and let them have it .
ENTP	War should be the only study of a prince . He should consider peace only as a breathing-time , which gives him leisure to contrive , and furnishes as ability to execute , military plans .
ESFP	Our most important task is to transform our consciousness so that violence is no longer an option for us in our personal lives , that understanding that a world of peace is possible only if we relate to each other as peaceful beings , one individual at a time .
ISTJ	We are going to have peace even if we have to fight for it .
ESFJ	If you want peace , you do n't talk to your friends . You talk to your enemies .
ESTP	America is a Nation with a mission - and that mission comes from our most basic beliefs . We have no desire to dominate , no ambitions of empire . Our aim is a democratic peace - a peace founded upon the dignity and rights of every man and woman .
ESTJ	Egypt has been a partner of the United States over the last 30 years , has been instrumental in keeping the peace in the Middle East between Egypt and Israel , which is a critical accomplishment that has meant so much to so many people .
ESTJ	The need for peace in Northern Ireland goes well beyond political stability . It now speaks to regional Europe and even global stability .
ESTP	We will stand up for our friends in the world . And one of the most important friends is the State of Israel . My administration will be steadfast in support Israel against terrorism and violence , and in seeking the peace for which all Israelis pray .
ISFJ	War may sometimes be a necessary evil . But no matter how necessary , it is always an evil , never a good . We will not learn how to live together in peace by killing each other 's children .
ENFP	I get those fleeting , beautiful moments of inner peace and stillness - and then the other 23 hours and 45 minutes of the day , I 'm a human trying to make it through in this world .
INFJ	When you 've seen beyond yourself , then you may find , peace of mind is waiting there .
INTP	Nothing is wrong with peace and love . It is all the more regrettable that so many of Christ 's followers seem to disagree .
ISTJ	The people of the world genuinely want peace . Some day the leaders of the world are going to have to give in and give , it to them .
ESTP	I just want you to know that , when we talk about war , we 're really talking about peace .
ISTJ	No nation ever had an army large enough to guarantee it against attack in time of peace , or ensure it of victory in time of war .
ESFJ	The purposes of the United States should not be doubted . The Security Council resolutions will be enforced - the just demands of peace and security will be met - or action will be unavoidable . And a regime that has lost its legitimacy will also lose its power .
ISFP	I have never advocated war except as a means of peace .
ISFP	Although a soldier by profession , I have never felt any sort of fondness for war , and I have never advocated it , except as a means of peace .
INTP	Little else is requisite to carry a state to the highest degree of opulence from the lowest barbarism but peace , easy taxes , and a tolerable administration of justice : all the rest being brought about by the natural course of things .
ESFJ	I would rather have peace in the world than be President .
ESTP	We 've climbed the mighty mountain . I see the valley below , and it 's a valley of peace .
ISFJ	We will not learn how to live together in peace by killing each other 's children .
ESTP	We know that dictators are quick to choose aggression , while free nations strive to resolve differences in peace .
ESTP	Peace , above all things , is to be desired , but blood must sometimes be spilled to obtain it on equable and lasting terms .
INTJ	God is day and night , winter and summer , war and peace , surfeit and hunger .
ESFJ	The minute you got the Nobel Peace Prize , things that I said yesterday , with nobody paying too much attention , I say the same things after I got it - oh ! It was quite crucial for people , and it helped our morale because apartheid did look invincible .
ESFJ	In many ways , when you 're a Nobel peace laureate , you have an obligation to humankind , to society .
INTJ	Neutrality is a negative word . It does not express what America ought to feel . We are not trying to keep out of trouble we are trying to preserve the foundations on which peace may be rebuilt .
ESFJ	I do n't think I 've ever felt that same kind of peace , the kind of serenity that I felt after acknowledging that maybe I was going to die of this TB .
INFJ	For peace is not mere absence of war , but is a virtue that springs from , a state of mind , a disposition for benevolence , confidence , justice .
ISFJ	We can not be both the world 's leading champion of peace and the world 's leading supplier of the weapons of war .
ESTJ	When we were at peace , Democrats wanted to raise taxes . Now there 's a war , so Democrats want to raise taxes . When there was a surplus , Democrats wanted to raise taxes . Now that there is a mild recession , Democrats want to raise taxes .
ISFJ	On balance , my life has been a constant stream of blessings rather than disappointments and failures and tragedies . I wish I had been re-elected . I think I could have kept our country at peace . I think I could have consolidated what we achieved at Camp David with a treaty between Israel and the Palestinians .
ISFJ	Because I know about the Holy Land , I 've taught lessons about the Holy Land all my life , and - but you ca n't bring peace to Israel without giving the Palestinian also peace . And Lebanon and Jordan and Syria as well .
INTJ	The world must be made safe for democracy . Its peace must be planted upon the tested foundations of political liberty .
ENFJ	Martin Luther King Jr. is remembered as our prince of peace , of civil rights . We owe him something major that will keep his memory alive .
ISFJ	My constant prayer , my number one foreign goal , is to bring peace to Israel . And in the process to Israel 's neighbours .
ISFJ	When I was elected President nobody asked me to negotiate between Israel and Egypt . It was not even a question raised in my campaign . But I felt that one of the reasons that I was elected President was to try to bring peace to the Holy Land .
ISFJ	When I was in the White House , I was confronted with the challenge of the Cold War . Both the Soviet Union and I had 30,000 nuclear weapons that could destroy the entire earth and I had to maintain the peace .
ISFP	I 'm at peace .
ISFP	Let us have peace .
ENTJ	At the end , the realization is that she had to get to a place in her life where she could drop her guard and make peace with the fact that whether she had a small amount of time , that she had to kind of live it completely through , instead of living by the rules .
INFJ	The real discovery is the one which enables me to stop doing philosophy when I want to . The one that gives philosophy peace , so that it is no longer tormented by questions which bring itself into question .
ISFJ	I 'm married . My wife , Stella - a beautiful woman . She 's brought a lot of peace to my life , a lot of wisdom .
INTP	If there are finer beings than German short hairs , I do n't know what they are . In their eyes is peace .
ENFJ	But in terms of how people live together , how we minimize the prospects of conflict and maximize the prospects of peace , the place of religion in our society today is essential .
ESTJ	Four years of Jimmy Carter gave us two titanic Reagan landslides , peace and prosperity for eight blessed years - and even a third term for his feckless vice president , George H.W . Bush .
INFJ	Peace is not the absence of war , but a virtue based on strength of character .
ENFJ	The threat today is not that of the 1930s . It 's not big powers going to war with each other . The ravages which fundamentalist political ideology inflicted on the 20th century are memories . The Cold war is over . Europe is at peace , if not always diplomatically .
ENFJ	Without free , self-respecting , and autonomous citizens there can be no free and independent nations . Without internal peace , that is , peace among citizens and between the citizens and the state , there can be no guarantee of external peace .
ENFJ	What we need is Star Peace and not Star Wars .
ISTJ	That a man be willing , when others are so too , as far forth as for peace and defense of himself he shall think it necessary , to lay down this right to all things and be contented with so much liberty against other men , as he would allow other men against himself .
ESFJ	The aggressive , unprovoked acts of violence against Israel by Hezbollah and Hamas are revealing . It is clear they do n't want peace , but rather seek the ultimate destruction of Israel .
ENTJ	The Nobel Peace Prize opened up a door in my heart .
ESTJ	It has been , after all , 11 years , more than a decade now , of defiance of U.N. resolutions by Saddam Hussein . Every obligation that he signed onto after the Gulf War , so that he would not be a threat to peace and security , he has ignored and flaunted .
ESTJ	Israel ca n't make peace without the clear support of the United States .
ESTJ	I am deeply concerned that , without peace and a two-state solution , the Jewish and democratic nature of Israel is in danger . That 's why I have opposed Israel 's settlement policy since 1973 , and that 's why I have favored a two-state solution since 1967 .
ESTJ	I am a peace supporting Jew .
ISFP	Deregulation created this epidemic of greed which according to the rules of capitalism was OK . Beyond that there was criminal behaviour . There have been no repercussions and it 's hard to make your peace with .
ISTP	It 's well known I 'm a Scientologist , and that has helped me to find that inner peace in my life and it 's something that has given me great stability and tools that I use .
ESTJ	I really am a woman at peace .
ESTJ	Success is not assured , but America is resolute : this is the best chance for peace we are likely to see for some years to come - and we are acting to help Israelis and Palestinians seize this chance .
ENFP	Peace does exist . It exists in your heart and soul .
ISFJ	You have to make peace with yourself . The key is to find the harmony in what you have .
INTP	No matter how much cats fight , there always seem to be plenty of kittens .
ESTP	I am fond of pigs . Dogs look up to us . Cats look down on us . Pigs treat us as equals .
ISTJ	Time spent with cats is never wasted .
INFP	I wish I could write as mysterious as a cat .
ESFJ	The average dog is a nicer person than the average person .
ISTP	I poured spot remover on my dog . Now he 's gone .
ENFP	To his dog , every man is Napoleon hence the constant popularity of dogs .
ISTJ	What counts is not necessarily the size of the dog in the fight - it 's the size of the fight in the dog .
ENFP	Do n't sweat the petty things and do n't pet the sweaty things .
ESTJ	A real Christian is a person who can give his pet parrot to the town gossip .
ISFP	I got a pet monkey called Charlie Chan .
ISTP	My roommate got a pet elephant . Then it got lost . It 's in the apartment somewhere .
ISTJ	When a guy tells me I 'm cute , it 's not something desirable . Cute is more like what you want your pet to be .
ENFP	Vinyl is the real deal . I 've always felt like , until you buy the vinyl record , you do n't really own the album . And it 's not just me or a little pet thing or some kind of retro romantic thing from the past . It is still alive .
ESTJ	Environmentalists hate sprawl - except when it comes to the size of their expansive pet legislation on Capitol Hill .
ISFJ	I have some road rage inside of me . Traffic , especially in L.A. , is a pet peeve of mine .
ENFP	All bad poetry springs from genuine feeling .
ENFP	A poet can survive everything but a misprint .
ISTP	I was reading the dictionary . I thought it was a poem about everything .
ENTP	One merit of poetry few persons will deny : it says more and in fewer words than prose .
ENFP	A poet 's work is to name the unnameable , to point at frauds , to take sides , start arguments , shape the world , and stop it going to sleep .
INFJ	Poetry is just the evidence of life . If your life is burning well , poetry is just the ash .
INTP	Pure mathematics is , in its way , the poetry of logical ideas .
ESFP	When power leads man toward arrogance , poetry reminds him of his limitations . When power narrows the area of man 's concern , poetry reminds him of the richness and diversity of existence . When power corrupts , poetry cleanses .
INFP	Listen , real poetry does n't say anything it just ticks off the possibilities . Opens all doors . You can walk through anyone that suits you .
INFP	If my poetry aims to achieve anything , it 's to deliver people from the limited ways in which they see and feel .
ISFP	I read poetry to save time .
ISFP	I do n't think I 've ever read poetry , ever .
INFP	With me poetry has not been a purpose , but a passion .
ISFP	It 's not easy to define poetry .
ENTP	The true spirit of delight , the exaltation , the sense of being more than Man , which is the touchstone of the highest excellence , is to be found in mathematics as surely as poetry .
INFJ	When it comes to atoms , language can be used only as in poetry . The poet , too , is not nearly so concerned with describing facts as with creating images .
INTP	The Bible should be taught , but emphatically not as reality . It is fiction , myth , poetry , anything but reality . As such it needs to be taught because it underlies so much of our literature and our culture .
INTP	I love romantic poetry .
ENFP	As an actor , there is room for a certain amount of creativity , but you 're always ultimately going to be saying somebody else 's words . I do n't think I 'd have the stamina , skill or ability to write a novel , but I 'd love to write short stories and poetry , because those are my two passions .
INFJ	I never really liked poetry readings I liked to read poetry by myself , but I liked singing , chanting my lyrics to this jazz group .
INFJ	I always thought that poetry is the verdict that others give to a certain kind of writing . So to call yourself a poet is a kind of dangerous description . It 's for others it 's for others to use .
INFJ	I think the term poet is a very exalted term and should be applied to a man at the end of his work . When he looks back over the body of his work and he 's written poetry then let the verdict be that he 's a poet .
ESTP	I always wrote poetry and stuff like that , so putting songs together was n't that spectacular .
INTJ	I think there are things in my story that have helped my creativity . Your father being killed , for instance , is one of the best things that could happen to a kid if he 's going to write poetry or songs .
ENFP	I wrote some bad poetry that I published in North African journals , but even as I withdrew into this reading , I also led the life of a kind of young hooligan .
ENTP	I wrote things for the school 's newspaper , and - like all teenagers - I dabbled in poetry .
ISFP	I do n't write poetry and then strum some chords and then fit the words on top of the chords .
ENFP	We are looking to brands for poetry and for spirituality , because we 're not getting those things from our communities or from each other .
ENFP	Suppose you were an idiot , and suppose you were a member of Congress but I repeat myself .
INFJ	It is better to be violent , if there is violence in our hearts , than to put on the cloak of nonviolence to cover impotence .
ENTJ	I am extraordinarily patient , provided I get my own way in the end .
ESTP	If you have ten thousand regulations you destroy all respect for the law .
ESTP	Healthy citizens are the greatest asset any country can have .
INFJ	Whenever a man has cast a longing eye on offices , a rottenness begins in his conduct .
ENFP	Principles have no real force except when one is well-fed .
ENFJ	If the United States of America or Britain is having elections , they do n't ask for observers from Africa or from Asia . But when we have elections , they want observers .
ENTP	Politics have no relation to morals .
ENTJ	Those who stand for nothing fall for anything .
ENTP	Perseverance is the hard work you do after you get tired of doing the hard work you already did .
ESFP	Inflation is as violent as a mugger , as frightening as an armed robber and as deadly as a hit man .
INFJ	The darkest places in hell are reserved for those who maintain their neutrality in times of moral crisis .
ESFJ	A leader in the Democratic Party is a boss , in the Republican Party he is a leader .
ISFJ	Conservatism has had from its inception vigorously positive , intellectually rigorous agenda and thinking . That agenda should have in my three pillars : strengthen the economy , strengthen our security , and strengthen our families .
INTJ	In politics the middle way is none at all .
ESFJ	You want a friend in Washington ? Get a dog .
ENFJ	The successful revolutionary is a statesman , the unsuccessful one a criminal .
ENTP	Conservatives are not necessarily stupid , but most stupid people are conservatives .
ESFJ	All the president is , is a glorified public relations man who spends his time flattering , kissing , and kicking people to get them to do what they are supposed to do anyway .
ENTJ	He who knows how to flatter also knows how to slander .
INTP	Hell hath no fury like a bureaucrat scorned .
ISTJ	Oh , that lovely title , ex-president .
INTJ	A conservative is a man who just sits and thinks , mostly sits .
INFJ	The secret of getting things done is to act !
INTJ	A conservative is someone who makes no changes and consults his grandmother when in doubt .
ENFP	Turn on to politics , or politics will turn on you .
ENFP	I 've been to war , and it 's not easy to kill . It 's bloody and messy and totally horrifying , and the consequences are serious .
INFJ	I never considered a difference of opinion in politics , in religion , in philosophy , as cause for withdrawing from a friend .
INTP	Politics is for the present , but an equation is for eternity .
ESFP	It has been said that politics is the second oldest profession . I have learned that it bears a striking resemblance to the first .
INTP	I was losing interest in politics , when the repeal of the Missouri Compromise aroused me again . What I have done since then is pretty well known .
ESTP	Politics is the ability to foretell what is going to happen tomorrow , next week , next month and next year . And to have the ability afterwards to explain why it did n't happen .
ESTP	Politics is almost as exciting as war , and quite as dangerous . In war you can only be killed once , but in politics many times .
ESTP	In war , you can only be killed once , but in politics , many times .
ESTP	I am never going to have anything more to do with politics or politicians . When this war is over I shall confine myself entirely to writing and painting .
ESTP	Politics are very much like war . We may even have to use poison gas at times .
INFJ	Those who say religion has nothing to do with politics do not know what religion is .
ESTP	In politics , nothing happens by accident . If it happens , you can bet it was planned that way .
ESFP	Politics I supposed to be the second-oldest profession . I have come to realize that it bears a very close resemblance to the first .

ESTP	The most practical kind of politics is the politics of decency .
ENFJ	Before I went to jail , I was active in politics as a member of South Africa 's leading organization - and I was generally busy from 7 A.M. until midnight . I never had time to sit and think .
ENTP	There is probably a perverse pride in my administration ... that we were going to do the right thing , even if short-term it was unpopular . And I think anybody who 's occupied this office has to remember that success is determined by an intersection in policy and politics and that you ca n't be neglecting of marketing and P.R . and public opinion .
ENFP	The trouble with Nixon is that he 's a serious politics junkie . He 's totally hooked and like any other junkie , he 's a bummer to have around , especially as President .
ENTP	Part of the reason that our politics seems so tough right now and facts and science and argument does not seem to be winning the day all the time is because we 're hardwired not to always think clearly when we 're scared . And the country 's scared .
ENFP	The most shocking fact about war is that its victims and its instruments are individual human beings , and that these individual beings are condemned by the monstrous conventions of politics to murder or be murdered in quarrels not their own .
ENTJ	There are still people in my party who believe in consensus politics . I regard them as Quislings , as traitors ... I mean it .

ESTJ	I think that you can disagree with people and debate over their positions with issues without engaging in the politics of personal destruction .

INTJ	I must not write a word to you about politics , because you are a woman .
ESTJ	In every country today , there is politics . It may be authoritarian politics , but there is politics .
ESTJ	I was in civil society long before I was ever in politics or my husband was ever even elected president .
INFP	If you have embraced a creed which appears to be free from the ordinary dirtiness of politics - a creed from which you yourself can not expect to draw any material advantage - surely that proves that you are in the right ?
INFP	What is a wife and what is a harlot ? What is a church and what is a theatre ? are they two and not one ? Can they exist separate ? Are not religion and politics the same thing ? Brotherhood is religion . O demonstrations of reason dividing families in cruelty and pride !
ISTJ	When you are in any contest , you should work as if there were - to the very last minute - a chance to lose it . This is battle , this is politics , this is anything .
ISTJ	Politics is a profession a serious , complicated and , in its true sense , a noble one .
ENTP	Politics and the pulpit are terms that have little agreement .
INTJ	Politics is a science . You can demonstrate that you are right and that others are wrong .

ESTP	If you 're sick and tired of the politics of cynicism and polls and principles , come and join this campaign .
INTP	From politics , it was an easy step to silence .
INFJ	The advantage of the internet is that it has taken away the charade of politics . China has heard of democracy and people know about certain concepts they would n't have previously .
ESTP	What we won when all of our people united must not be lost in suspicion and distrust and selfishness and politics . Accordingly , I shall not seek , and I will not accept , the nomination of my party for another term as president .
ESTP	One lesson you better learn if you want to be in politics is that you never go out on a golf course and beat the President .
INTJ	Politics I conceive to be nothing more than the science of the ordered progress of society along the lines of greatest usefulness and convenience to itself .
ESTP	I seldom think of politics more than eighteen hours a day .
ESTJ	I think that people are tired . They 're tired of the same old kind of politics . People want a new tone to politics .
ISTP	First rule of politics : you ca n't win unless you 're on the ballot . Second rule : If you run , you may lose . And , if you tie , you do not win .
ISTP	Politics is human beings it 's addition rather than subtraction .
ISTP	In politics , every day is filled with numerous opportunities for serious error . Enjoy it .
INTJ	I do n't think consensus-building politics is what I 'm meant to be doing .
INTJ	The advice I 've been giving to people all my life - that you may not be interested in the dialectic but the dialectic is interested in you you ca n't give up politics , it wo n't give you up - was the advice I should have been taking myself .
INTJ	The term 'the American Left ' is as near to being meaningless or nonsensical as any term could really be in politics . It is n't really a force in politics anymore . And it would do well to ask itself why that is .
ENFP	The 'democracy gap ' in our politics and elections spells a deep sense of powerlessness by people who drop out , do not vote , or listlessly vote for the 'least worst ' every four years and then wonder why after every cycle the 'least worst ' gets worse .
ENTP	Politics and war are remarkably similar situations .
ENFP	I do n't know why that is , but English politics is just so overly white . It 's very much about the class structure .
ENFJ	War is not the continuation of politics with different means , it is the greatest mass-crime perpetrated on the community of man .
ENFJ	You 've got to watch the politics of AIDS . The politics of AIDS can work both for and against the victims of AIDS .
ESTP	The message that I gave on the - on the steps today was that you need to stand for those things that are right and empower the individual . Believe in the power of one person . Do n't believe that you ca n't do it . Everybody wants - everybody wants a shot . That we can all agree on . Beyond that , it becomes politics . I 'm not talking politics .
ESTP	I do n't fancy myself a political commentator . I hate politics . I hate it .
ENFJ	You know , the media and politicians are always gon na be in a bit of tension with one another and probably most of the time that 's healthy and indeed even creative . But it 's where - it 's really when news organisations are used as kind of instruments of politics that it gets tricky .
ESFJ	Politics is n't just a game of clashing parties and competing interests . The right reason is to challenge the status quo , to serve the common good , and to leave this nation better than we found it .
ENFJ	In no relationship at the top of any walk of life is it always easy , least of all in politics which matters so much and which is conducted in such a piercing spotlight .
ENFJ	I mean , I went to a church school when I was younger and imbibed a certain amount of religion then but it was really in university that I got interested in religion and politics at the same time . I do n't think as if it were one moment of conversion but my spiritual journey really began then .
ESFJ	The lesson of the last year is this : foreign policy ca n't be managed through the politics of personality , and our President would do well to take note of an observation John F. Kennedy made once he was in office - that all of the world 's problems are n't his predecessor 's fault .
ENTJ	Frankly , if you do politics , you should not be thinking about your dignity .
ISFP	Most people do n't want to talk about politics and religion . They say , 'Let 's talk about something else . '
ENTJ	I was in elective politics for 24 years . I 've made four national races , two for President , two for Vice President . I have found there are other ways to serve , and I 'm enjoying them .
ENTJ	In general people feel more relaxed about participating in politics . They are n't frightened as they used to be .
ENTJ	In politics , you also have to be cautiously optimistic .
ESTJ	I did n't run for student council president . I do n't see myself in any way in elected office . I love policy . I 'm not particularly fond of politics .
ESTJ	It 's a good question , because a movie is n't good or bad based on its politics . It 's usually good or bad for other reasons , though you might agree or disagree with its politics .
ESTJ	Well , you know what , I 'm 60 years old , and I 've been interested in politics since I was on my daddy 's knee . During the 1948 election , we were praying for Truman . I know a lot about politics .
ENTJ	If I cry , it 's about the personal loss of a friend or something like that . But when it comes to politics - no , I do n't cry .
INFP	I do n't know if anybody wants to mix their politics with their entertainment .
INTP	If there is one eternal truth of politics , it is that there are always a dozen good reasons for doing nothing .
ENTJ	If you really want to diminish a candidate , depict him as the foil of his handler . This is as old in American politics as politics itself .
ENTJ	Look , there ought to be politics in politics .
ENTJ	The fallback position in politics is if you do n't know what you want to be about , and if you do n't know what your vision is , go at somebody else .
ENTJ	Negative politics have always been around .
ENTJ	I 'll never get out of politics . I have friends in public office . I have things that I want to do . You ca n't go back in life . I wo n't go back to the existence I had before of running a political consulting firm and signing up clients and advising campaigns in exactly that way .
ENTJ	I know enough about European politics to know you 've got a lot of crazy people who make their way onto the ballot .
INFP	I 'm not going to talk like I know about politics , because I 'm a total amateur , but maybe I can be a spokesperson for people who are n't normally interested in politics .
INFP	But I 'm not interested in politics . I lose interest the microsecond it ceases to be emotional , when something becomes a political movement . What I 'm interested in is emotions .
ISFP	I do n't get involved in record label politics .
ESTJ	The idea that religion and politics do n't mix was invented by the Devil to keep Christians from running their own country .
ENTP	In politics a capable ruler must be guided by circumstances , conjectures and conjunctions .
ENTJ	I get asked a lot about getting into politics . I say , 'Take a look at politics . You tell me what seems appealing about that . '
ISTJ	On the one hand , the financial projection is on the agenda - we will see if this problem can be resolved or not . I think it is a right idea to stage a special summit , which would deal with the question of priorities of European politics .
ISTJ	That is why everyone in politics , and we do it , must make sure that they do not depend on one single interest group . A good compromise is one where everybody makes a contribution .
ISTJ	Thus , the focus on this main political goal must become more visible in EU politics and to achieve this , we need a political impulse . It must be clear what the priorities on the agenda are .
ISTJ	Whoever decides to dedicate their life to politics knows that earning money is n't the top priority .
ISTP	I have always hated celebrities lecturing people on politics . So forgive me . But I am passionate about this country . I am equally passionate about the potential of the people who live here .
ISFJ	I think the rules are going to have to change for me to ever run for public office . My checkered past will always keep me out of politics .
ENFP	Acting is fun and I refuse to get involved in the semantics and the politics of strategy and breaking out of something or doing something because you need to do something else . For me it 's all about what fuels my soul and if I 'm passionate about a screenplay then that 's what I 'll do next .
ESFP	Well , I think any time you delve into this sort of religion , politics , as you well know , you 're going to , you know , touch a few nerves . I was n't - now - and this is the honest truth .
ESFP	When you are enthusiastic about what you do , you feel this positive energy . It 's very simple .
ISFJ	If you are given a chance to be a role model , I think you should always take it because you can influence a person 's life in a positive light , and that 's what I want to do . That 's what it 's all about .
ESFP	I 'm looking forward to influencing others in a positive way . My message is you can do anything if you just put your mind to it .
ENTP	And we can see the positive impacts right here at Solyndra . Less than a year ago , we were standing on what was an empty lot.But through the Recovery Act , this company received a loan to expand its operations . This new factory is the result of those loans .
ESTJ	There is a sense that things , if you keep positive and optimistic about what can be done , do work out .
ESFP	You ca n't live a positive life with a negative mind and if you have a positive outcome you have a positive income and just to have more positivity and just to kind of laugh it off .
ISFJ	Well , you know , a lot of people look at the negative things , the things that they did wrong and - which I do . But I like to stress on the things I did right , because there are certain things that I like to look at from a positive standpoint that are just positive reinforcement .
INFP	Suffering is the positive element in this world , indeed it is the only link between this world and the positive .
ESFJ	I 've been singing for six years . I 've been in and out of the studios with top producers , but it was n't something I was ready to express to the public or to the press . I was n't ready to come out . I wanted to perfect my voice and be 100 percent positive that I could come out right .
ESFP	Those minutes that I 'm on stage are the best ! Being there and looking at the crowd and seeing their faces , hearing them sing the positive words from the songs .
ESTJ	People do n't really understand , but having people stare , and point , and take pictures , even if it is in a positive framework , is quite isolating there 's no two ways about it . You feel a little bit , you know , freakish .
ENTP	There 's a weird cloud around you when you 're recognizable . It was a brief window for me . I think you have to have a pathological need for attention of any type , negative or positive , to thrive in that kind of situation . And I only want compliments .
INFP	I do n't like to read about myself , whether it be positive or negative .
INTP	I have always viewed the mission of Wikipedia to be much bigger than just creating a killer website . We 're doing that of course , and having a lot of fun doing it , but a big part of what motivates us is our larger mission to affect the world in a positive way .
ISFP	I 'm a positive person , and I try to look at the good side of everything .
ISFP	I would like to be a positive force for young girls .
INFJ	To be perfectly honest , I feel I have a duty to use my celebrity status in a positive way .
INFP	I think everyone goes through chapters in their life and there was a time when I was n't feeling terribly positive about what I was contributing to film , or was n't feeling as if I was going in the direction I wanted and I re-evaluated what I was doing .
ENFP	I would like to do something dark or small . I love independent films . I love emotional scenes . I love people who are struggling with something . I think it 's just the juxtaposition to my incredibly happy , positive demeanor .
ISTJ	And what we 've lost sight of is that performing manual labor with your hands is one of the most incredibly satisfying and positive things you can do .
ESFJ	I 'm a very driven , ambitious , positive person . But I 'm a spiritual person as well . I believe in creative visualization . So for me to go to America - which I find such a positive place - well , I took to it like a duck to water .
ENTJ	Being powerful is like being a lady . If you have to tell people you are , you are n't .
INTJ	All things are subject to interpretation whichever interpretation prevails at a given time is a function of power and not truth .
ISTP	The less effort , the faster and more powerful you will be .
ENTJ	What it lies in our power to do , it lies in our power not to do .
INTJ	Every man builds his world in his own image . He has the power to choose , but no power to escape the necessity of choice .
INTJ	The world itself is the will to power - and nothing else ! And you yourself are the will to power - and nothing else !
INTJ	To achieve , you need thought . You have to know what you are doing and that 's real power .
ENFJ	There is no meaning to life except the meaning man gives his life by the unfolding of his powers .
INFJ	Power is given only to those who dare to lower themselves and pick it up . Only one thing matters , one thing to be able to dare !
ENTP	The greater the power , the more dangerous the abuse .
ENFP	But to me nothing - the negative , the empty - is exceedingly powerful .
ESTP	It is folly for a man to pray to the gods for that which he has the power to obtain by himself .
INTJ	My relationship to power and authority is that I 'm all for it . People need somebody to watch over them . Ninety-five percent of the people in the world need to be told what to do and how to behave .
ENTJ	The value systems of those with access to power and of those far removed from such access can not be the same . The viewpoint of the privileged is unlike that of the underprivileged .

INFP	Words have no power to impress the mind without the exquisite horror of their reality .
ISFJ	You have power over your mind - not outside events . Realize this , and you will find strength .
ISTP	Respect your efforts , respect yourself . Self-respect leads to self-discipline . When you have both firmly under your belt , that 's real power .
ENFJ	Passion is energy . Feel the power that comes from focusing on what excites you .
ENTJ	In a democracy the poor will have more power than the rich , because there are more of them , and the will of the majority is supreme .
ESFP	All the waste in a year from a nuclear power plant can be stored under a desk .
ENTJ	A sense is what has the power of receiving into itself the sensible forms of things without the matter , in the way in which a piece of wax takes on the impress of a signet-ring without the iron or gold .
ESFP	Now we have a problem in making our power credible , and Vietnam is the place .
INTJ	I assess the power of a will by how much resistance , pain , torture it endures and knows how to turn to its advantage .
ENTJ	We have also arranged things so that almost no one understands science and technology . This is a prescription for disaster . We might get away with it for a while , but sooner or later this combustible mixture of ignorance and power is going to blow up in our faces .
INTJ	Undeserved praise causes more pangs of conscience later than undeserved blame , but probably only for this reason , that our power of judgment are more completely exposed by being over praised than by being unjustly underestimated .

ISTJ	Arbitrary power is most easily established on the ruins of liberty abused to licentiousness .
ISTJ	The constitution vests the power of declaring war in Congress therefore no offensive expedition of importance can be undertaken until after they shall have deliberated upon the subject and authorized such a measure .
ISTP	This revolution , the information revoultion , is a revolution of free energy as well , but of another kind : free intellectual energy . It 's very crude today , yet our Macintosh computer takes less power than a 100-watt bulb to run it and it can save you hours a day . What will it be able to do ten or 20 years from now , or 50 years from now ?
INFP	All modern revolutions have ended in a reinforcement of the power of the State .
ENTJ	Power is like being a lady ... if you have to tell people you are , you are n't .
INFP	Doublethink means the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one 's mind simultaneously , and accepting both of them .

ISFP	I do n't think I 've ever been an agnostic . I 've always thought there 's a superior power , that this is not the real world and that there 's a world to come .
ENTP	Tonight , we gather to affirm the greatness of our nation - not because of the height of our skyscrapers , or the power of our military , or the size of our economy . Our pride is based on a very simple premise , summed up in a declaration made over two hundred years ago .

INTP	Where an excess of power prevails , property of no sort is duly respected . No man is safe in his opinions , his person , his faculties , or his possessions .
ESTP	Mischief springs from the power which the moneyed interest derives from a paper currency which they are able to control , from the multitude of corporations with exclusive privileges ... which are employed altogether for their benefit .

INTP	Except our own thoughts , there is nothing absolutely in our power .
ENTJ	One should never forbid what one lacks the power to prevent .

INTP	Wherever there is interest and power to do wrong , wrong will generally be done .

But what they were able to do , especially in Philadelphia in 1787 , four months , they argued about what a House should be , what a Senate should be , the power of the president , the Congress , the Supreme Court . And they had to deal with slavery .

ENTP	The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community , against his will , is to prevent harm to others . His own good , either physical or moral , is not sufficient warrant .
INFP	Odd how the creative power at once brings the whole universe to order .
ENTP	The general tendency of things throughout the world is to render mediocrity the ascendant power among mankind .
ISFP	I 'm not after fame and success and fortune and power . It 's mostly that I want to have a good job and have good friends that 's the good stuff in life .
ESTP	Use power to help people . For we are given power not to advance our own purposes nor to make a great show in the world , nor a name . There is but one just use of power and it is to serve people .
ISFP	I 'm not the same person I was . I used to act dumb . It was an act . I am 26 years old , and that act is no longer cute . It is not who I am , nor do I want to be that person for the young girls who looked up to me . I know now that I can make a difference , that I have the power to do that .

ENTJ	Militant feminists are pro-choice because it 's their ultimate avenue of power over men . And believe me , to them it is a question of power . It is their attempt to impose their will on the rest of society , particularly on men .
ENFP	People who avoid the brick walls - all power to ya , but we all have to hit them sometimes in order to push through to the next level , to evolve .
INTJ	I used to wish there was a useful term for those of us who thought American power should be used to remove psychopathic dictators .
ENFJ	The salvation of this human world lies nowhere else than in the human heart , in the human power to reflect , in human meekness and human responsibility .
ESTP	Every diminution of the public burdens arising from taxation gives to individual enterprise increased power and furnishes to all the members of our happy confederacy new motives for patriotic affection and support .
INTP	Revolutionaries do not make revolutions . The revolutionaries are those who know when power is lying in the street and then they can pick it up .
INFJ	I am opposed to the accumulation of executive power anywhere .
INFJ	To give aid to every poor man is far beyond the reach and power of every man . Care of the poor is incumbent on society as a whole .
ENTP	The law always limits every power it gives .
INTJ	When you give everyone a voice and give people power , the system usually ends up in a really good place . So , what we view our role as , is giving people that power .
ISTJ	During the time men live without a common power to keep them all in awe , they are in that conditions called war and such a war , as if of every man , against every man .
INFJ	I 'd always felt very strongly in the power of vocation .
ISFJ	Emotional power is maybe the most valuable thing that an actor can have .
ENFP	Power has to be insecure to be responsive .
INFJ	Concentration of executive power , unless it 's very temporary and for specific circumstances , let 's say fighting world war two , it 's an assault on democracy .
INFJ	The 'anti-globalisation movement ' is the most significant proponent of globalisation - but in the interests of people , not concentrations of state-private power .
ESTP	I 'm not a power person . I like everyone to be on an equal footing .
INTP	No punishment has ever possessed enough power of deterrence to prevent the commission of crimes . On the contrary , whatever the punishment , once a specific crime has appeared for the first time , its reappearance is more likely than its initial emergence could ever have been .
ENFJ	It 's easy to dislike the few senior women out there . What if women were half the positions in power ? It would be harder to dislike all of them .
ISFP	I think actors are getting so much more power these days , but I 'm not . I stay very much away from the decisions , the way in which things are orchestrated , what 's been changed . I just try to stay completely in the role as the actor and as the character .
INTJ	The disruptive powers of excessive national fecundity may have played a greater part in bursting the bonds of convention than either the power of ideas or the errors of autocracy .
ENTJ	Something I learned very early on in my career is that there are a lot of things that you do not have any power over .
ENFJ	This nuclear option is ultimately an example of the arrogance of power .
ENFP	What one writer can make in the solitude of one room is something no power can easily destroy .
ENFP	Before , I was really passive , all I cared about was being in love with my boyfriend . I did n't have any creative power , nothing . I do n't know that person any more .
ISFJ	As a woman who has some sort of power , you have to have a man that can take that . It 's hard to find those men .
ISTJ	The obligation of subjects to the sovereign is understood to last as long , and no longer , than the power lasteth by which he is able to protect them .
ENFJ	I say to the Taliban : surrender the terrorists or surrender power . It 's your choice .
INFJ	Spiritual relationship is far more precious than physical . Physical relationship divorced from spiritual is body without soul .
ESTP	In a relationship each person should support the other they should lift each other up .
ESFP	Relationships based on obligation lack dignity .
INFP	When I got my first television set , I stopped caring so much about having close relationships .
ENFP	A relationship is n't going to make me survive . It 's the cherry on top .
ISFP	Every relationship I 've been in , I 've overwhelmed the girl . They just ca n't handle all the love .
ISFP	I 'm more of an adventurous type than a relationship type .
ENFP	So then , the relationship of self to other is the complete realization that loving yourself is impossible without loving everything defined as other than yourself .
ISFJ	I have to be in a relationship in order to be intimate . I 'm not the one-night-stand kind of girl . Despite the rumors .
ESTP	I could see myself in a relationship with a girl Olivia Wilde is so sexy she makes me want to strangle a mountain ox with my bare hands . She 's mesmerizing .
INFP	If one could be friendly with women , what a pleasure - the relationship so secret and private compared with relations with men . Why not write about it truthfully ?
ENFJ	But with Christ , we have access in a one-to-one relationship , for , as in the Old Testament , it was more one of worship and awe , a vertical relationship . The New Testament , on the other hand , we look across at a Jesus who looks familiar , horizontal . The combination is what makes the Cross .
ISFP	It 's important to take time for your spouse and nurture the relationship .
ESTP	There is but one way for a president to deal with Congress , and that is continuously , incessantly , and without interruption . If it is really going to work , the relationship has got to be almost incestuous .
ISFJ	I definitely think anything I 'd be in now is a permanent relationship .
ISFJ	There was at time in my life where all I wanted was a relationship , and I thought that was the most important thing .
ISFP	Being grown up and in a serious relationship , I 've learned so much . I 'm happier than I 've every been .
ENFP	I think a good relationship is about collaboration .
ISFP	And it was a very , very fruitful and great relationship between the Stones and The Beatles . It was very , very friendly .
INFP	The relationship to one 's fellow man is the relationship of prayer , the relationship to oneself is the relationship of striving it is from prayer that one draws the strength for one 's striving .
INTJ	In the grip of a neurological disorder , I am fast losing control of words even as my relationship with the world has been reduced to them .
INTJ	I 'm afraid the SS 's relationship with the Catholic Church is something the Church still has to deal with and does not deny .
INTP	Until we have a better relationship between private performance and the public truth , as was demonstrated with Watergate , we as the public are absolutely right to remain suspicious , contemptuous even , of the secrecy and the misinformation which is the digest of our news .
ENFJ	The test of one 's behavior pattern is their relationship to society , relationship to work and relationship to sex .
ESFJ	As you get older you have more respect and empathy for your parents . Now I have a great relationship with both of them .
INFJ	I have a strange relationship with time . I 'm not aware of it passing .
INFP	Have you ever loved somebody , loved her completely , but had to end the relationship for life reasons ?
ESFJ	I feel so lucky to have both a son and a daughter , because there 's a different relationship with each of them .
INFP	I have a great relationship with my mother-in-law . We 're both Leos , we understand each other .
INFP	When I play live , it 's a conversation that we 're all having with the song , and the audience ... their response and relationship with the songs is as valid as my relationship with the songs .
ESTP	When you think about it , we actors are kind of prostitutes . We get paid to feign attraction and love . Other people are paying to watch us kissing someone , touching someone , doing things people in a normal monogamous relationship would never do with anyone who 's not their partner . It 's really kind of gross .
INFP	I feel like the people from Iceland have a different relationship with their country than other places . Most Icelandic people are really proud to be from there , and we do n't have embarrassments like World War II where we were cruel to other people .
INFJ	I think I have a strange relationship with time . I 'm not really aware of that time passing . I do n't feel that I 'm wasteful with time . But I 'm not aware of it passing .
ENTP	I had a very , very difficult relationship with my mother , who was supremely self-centred . She was hilariously self-centred . She did not really take interest in anything that did n't immediately affect her .
ESFJ	I know children regress after vaccination because it happened to my own son . Why are n't there any tests out there on the safety of how vaccines are administered in the real world , six at a time ? Why have only two of the 36 shots our kids receive been looked at for their relationship to autism ?
ENTP	I think the fact that I 'm so well known to be gay makes it very difficult to have a convincing relationship with a woman on screen . It would n't be at all difficult for me to kiss a woman - I 'll kiss a frog if you like .
ENFP	I think the most important thing in life is self-love , because if you do n't have self-love , and respect for everything about your own body , your own soul , your own capsule , then how can you have an authentic relationship with anyone else ?
ESFJ	I 've always believed in people 's capacity for goodness . I still believe that people are good . What I 'm not so trusting about anymore is their relationship to their own goodness .
ESTJ	It is better to have a relationship with someone who cheats on you than with someone who does not flush the toilet .
ISFP	I think at some stage , I would love to have another child . I would love to settle into a relationship that was really important to me . I actually am not good at the balance at that .
ISFP	Even as a child I had a strong relationship with yearning and desire . And loss . Those things spoke to me .
ESFJ	But you know , I have a pretty good relationship with the press and the paparazzi . It 's just when they step over the line that , you know , enough 's enough .
ENTP	What works in a relationship of very public people is not making the relationship public - keeping it as personal as it can be . It 's the only way it is real .
INFJ	Look , you 've got a generation of people coming along who are going to form their own new relationship with the idea of supporting the causes that they care about or changing the world . And these people are not going to do it the way our parents do it .
ENTP	There 's a lot about the character . It does n't always happen , but there are some characters you really create a relationship with , almost as if they were your friend . And you never get into their heads again or think like them .
ESFJ	In a relationship , when does the art of compromise become compromising ?
ENTJ	When they watch a movie and they know that you 're in a relationship , you just kind of watch that constantly .
ESFJ	The thing that stood out above and beyond all the experiences was this relationship with the nine-month-old baby . On weekends , I 'd be thinking about going back to set on Monday just to see the baby .
ESTJ	I think every relationship has a point where you stop and reevaluate . Are you happy ? Have you grown together or apart ? What do you share interests in ? I think that 's a normal thing to do , but it 's so much harder when it 's done publicly .
ESFJ	I have a much better relationship with the press than I did , I think because I stood my ground .
INTP	But I think the real tension lies in the relationship between what you might call the pursuer and his quarry , whether it 's the writer or the spy .
ENTJ	I 'm always open to a relationship , but I 'm not putting those feelers out there now .
ENTJ	I am a relationship girl . That 's kind of just how I 'm made ... When you 're in my life , it 's actually very contained .
ISFP	I grew up very religious , and I do n't have a great relationship with religion .
INFP	There 's such an extreme feeling to be in love , especially in quite an emotionally destructive relationship , where you 're both kind of really bad for each other , but you love each other so much . Those extreme emotions , I think , can only be described with extreme imagery .
ISFP	It takes bravery to end a relationship .
ISFP	Obviously , a long-distance relationship is hard . But , like anything worth having , you make it work .
INFP	You know when you get into that thing where people want to discuss the relationship ? I 'd rather discuss what was on telly , avoid the issue , discuss anything other than the relationship .
INFP	This thing with everyone knowing you , it 's weird , because people have this one-sided relationship where they look at your picture and feel they know you more than someone they actually know . I do n't really know myself that well .
INFP	I 'm not one of these guys who 's constantly in a relationship , not at all .
ISFP	When a relationship does n't work anymore , it 's terrible to stay with someone that you do n't love .
ESFJ	I 've stepped more into my womanhood , I 'm a mother now , I 'm having a beautiful relationship as a wife and as a friend .
ENTJ	I 'd think , 'In a relationship , we should never have his kind of fight . ' Then , instead of figuring out how to make it work , I looked for a way to get out of it . The truth is , you should n't be married if your that kind of person .
ISTP	I 'm certainly not the first person to be in a relationship with a younger man , but somehow I was plucked out as a bit of a poster girl .
ISTP	I have had a love-hate relationship with my body .
ENTP	I think she definitely has . I think , um , her and Mulder 's relationship has become more equal . And , I think she has become stronger and more independent over the seasons .
ENFP	It 's impossible . You try to have any kind of relationship with your family , with a man , or with a friend , and you have to be on the phone and the Internet the entire time .
ESTP	Over the years , I 've been trying to build a relationship with an audience . I 've tried to maintain as much of a low profile as I could so that those characters would emerge and their relationship with audiences would be protected .
INTP	I also think the relationship I have with my audience is a lot more complex than what Hitchcock seemed to want his to be - although I think he had more going on under the surface as well .
ISFJ	Well I think if you really go out with someone for quite a long time you do get to know each other very , very well , you go through the good times , you go through the bad times . You know both personally , but also within a relationship as well .
ISFJ	I had never really dated . I 've always been a relationship kind of person .
ENFJ	Certain people in the United States are driving nails into this structure of our relationship , then cutting off the heads . So the Soviets must use their teeth to pull them out .
ISFP	Though I still have no semblance of a life outside of Nine Inch Nails at the moment , I realize my goals have gone from getting a record deal or selling another record to being a better person , more well-rounded , having friends , having a relationship with somebody .
ESFJ	Everyone has an opinion of who you are and what your relationship is about , things that you 've done or did n't do in your relationship - and it 's just all crap , really . Things that are written about it are all crap .
ENTJ	First of all , returning from motherhood , I was looking for something lighter , and I was n't as much attracted to Kate as I was to the relationship between the two people .
ENTJ	But it 's much more exciting to make Die Hard . One of the reasons that I think that movie is so successful is it deals with those very important blue-collar relationship themes . But it 's more visually beautiful to show things blowing up . It just gives you more on the screen .
ENTP	I do n't remember any sibling rivalry growing up , because by the time I was really conscious , Tom was going away to college . My relationship with him , which is a very close one , really developed in more recent years .
ISTP	I know the Russian political elite has got used to the Ukraine suffering from an inferiority complex , but I want this to disappear from our relationship .
INFJ	I like your Christ , I do not like your Christians . Your Christians are so unlike your Christ .
ENTJ	Religion is what keeps the poor from murdering the rich .
ESFJ	When the missionaries came to Africa they had the Bible and we had the land . They said 'Let us pray . ' We closed our eyes . When we opened them we had the Bible and they had the land .
INTP	Science without religion is lame , religion without science is blind .
INTP	My religion consists of a humble admiration of the illimitable superior spirit who reveals himself in the slight details we are able to perceive with our frail and feeble mind .
INTP	I am a deeply religious nonbeliever - this is a somewhat new kind of religion .
INTP	True religion is real living living with all one 's soul , with all one 's goodness and righteousness .
INTP	One strength of the communist system of the East is that it has some of the character of a religion and inspires the emotions of a religion .
INTP	I care not much for a man 's religion whose dog and cat are not the better for it .
INFJ	A religion that takes no account of practical affairs and does not help to solve them is no religion .
INFJ	It is in our lives and not our words that our religion must be read .
ENTJ	A tyrant must put on the appearance of uncommon devotion to religion . Subjects are less apprehensive of illegal treatment from a ruler whom they consider god-fearing and pious . On the other hand , they do less easily move against him , believing that he has the gods on his side .
INFJ	Difference of opinion is advantageous in religion . The several sects perform the office of a Censor - over each other .
ENFP	Every religion is true one way or another . It is true when understood metaphorically . But when it gets stuck in its own metaphors , interpreting them as facts , then you are in trouble .
INFJ	Gentleness , self-sacrifice and generosity are the exclusive possession of no one race or religion .
INFJ	One 's own religion is after all a matter between oneself and one 's Maker and no one else 's .
INFJ	Religion is a matter of the heart . No physical inconvenience can warrant abandonment of one 's own religion .
ENTP	All who think can not but see there is a sanction like that of religion which binds us in partnership in the serious work of the world .
ENFP	When we blindly adopt a religion , a political system , a literary dogma , we become automatons . We cease to grow .
INTJ	In Christianity neither morality nor religion come into contact with reality at any point .
INTJ	Religion is the impotence of the human mind to deal with occurrences it can not understand .
INTJ	There is not enough religion in the world even to destroy religion .
ENFP	Religion is just mind control .
ENTP	It 's not surprising , then , they get bitter , they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who are n't like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations .
ENFP	The more powerful and original a mind , the more it will incline towards the religion of solitude .
INTJ	Religion is the opium of the masses .
ENTP	Superstition is to religion what astrology is to astronomy the mad daughter of a wise mother . These daughters have too long dominated the earth .
ESFP	I do n't necessarily believe in organized religion .
INTJ	War is the greatest plague that can afflict humanity , it destroys religion , it destroys states , it destroys families . Any scourge is preferable to it .
ESTP	Selfishness is the only real atheism aspiration , unselfishness , the only real religion .
INTP	I am against religion because it teaches us to be satisfied with not understanding the world .
ENTP	Nothing can be more contrary to religion and the clergy than reason and common sense .
ENTP	It was not a religion that attacked us that September day . It was al-Qaeda . We will not sacrifice the liberties we cherish or hunker down behind walls of suspicion and mistrust .
ENTJ	Skeptical scrutiny is the means , in both science and religion , by which deep thoughts can be winnowed from deep nonsense .
ENTP	There is no surer sign of decay in a country than to see the rites of religion held in contempt .
ENTP	I say quite deliberately that the Christian religion , as organized in its Churches , has been and still is the principal enemy of moral progress in the world .
ESTP	Whoever seeks to set one religion against another seeks to destroy all religion .
INTJ	Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature , the heart of a heartless world , and the soul of soulless conditions . It is the opium of the people .
ISTJ	Religion is an illusion and it derives its strength from the fact that it falls in with our instinctual desires .
INTP	One of the things that is wrong with religion is that it teaches us to be satisfied with answers which are not really answers at all .
INFP	As with the Christian religion , the worst advertisement for Socialism is its adherents .
ENTJ	Religion is excellent stuff for keeping common people quiet .
ESTJ	In nearly every religion I am aware of , there is a variation of the golden rule . And even for the non-religious , it is a tenet of people who believe in humanistic principles .
INTP	Many of us saw religion as harmless nonsense . Beliefs might lack all supporting evidence but , we thought , if people needed a crutch for consolation , where 's the harm ? September 11th changed all that .
ENTP	We are a nation that is unenlightened because of religion . I do believe that . I think religion stops people from thinking . I think it justified crazies .
INTJ	The day is not far off when the economic problem will take the back seat where it belongs , and the arena of the heart and the head will be occupied or reoccupied , by our real problems - the problems of life and of human relations , of creation and behavior and religion .
ENTP	Nothing is so fatal to religion as indifference .
ENTP	Superstition is the religion of feeble minds .
INFP	Prisons are built with stones of Law . Brothels with the bricks of religion .
ENTP	I think flying planes into a building was a faith-based initiative . I think religion is a neurological disorder .
INTP	It would be intolerant if I advocated the banning of religion , but of course I never have .
ISFP	The humanists ' replacement for religion : work really hard and somehow you 'll either save yourself or you 'll be immortal . Of course , that 's a total joke , and our progress is nothing . There may be progress in technology but there 's no ethical progress whatsoever .
ENFP	Religion is not a department of life it is something that enters into the whole of it .
ENTP	The Christian religion not only was at first attended with miracles , but even at this day can not be believed by any reasonable person without one .
INFJ	My first memories of religion were being taken to Episcopal church . My father was Catholic , but my mother , I believe , was Episcopal . So I sort of veered off into the watered-down version of Catholicism .
INTP	Religion is the recognition of all our duties as divine commands .
INTJ	There is no higher religion than human service . To work for the common good is the greatest creed .
ENTP	Generally speaking , the errors in religion are dangerous those in philosophy only ridiculous .
ESFP	You know , religion itself , Eastern and Western , is divisive and quarrelsome anyway .
ENFP	I do n't have a religion . I believe in a God . I do n't know what it looks like but it 's MY god . My own interpretation of the supernatural .
ISTP	If I do n't talk about my religion , if I say I 'm not discussing it or different humanitarian things I 'm working on , they 're like , 'He 's avoiding it . ' If I do talk about it , it becomes , 'Oh , he 's proselytizing . '
ESFJ	God 's love is too great to be confined to any one side of a conflict or to any one religion .
ENTJ	It 's one thing to be religious , but it 's another thing to make religion your policy .
INTJ	Religion is compulsory in English schools , you know .
INTJ	Religion is not going to come up with any new arguments .
INTJ	I do n't think Romney is wacky at all , but religion makes intelligent people say and do wacky things , believe and affirm crazy things . Left on his own , Romney would never have said something like the Garden Of Eden was in Missouri , and will be again .
INFP	The fact that religion plays such a part in how people vote troubles me , troubles me as a minister 's daughter . Because I always felt that the separation of church and state was what our forefathers and foremothers really fought for .
ENFJ	There 's a gullible side to the American people . They can be easily misled . Religion is the best device used to mislead them .
ENFP	I 'm very interested in religion as something to study , but I 'm not a religious person in the slightest .
ENFP	Religion leaves no room for human complexity .
ESFP	I 'm not defined by where I came from . I never took part in the rules and hatred that sometimes go along with religion . But if my parents are happy with what they believe , then I 'm happy to stay out of their way . We agree to disagree .
ESFJ	I love the idea of the teachings of Jesus Christ and the beautiful stories about it , which I loved in Sunday school and I collected all the little stickers and put them in my book . But the reality is that organised religion does n't seem to work . It turns people into hateful lemmings and it 's not really compassionate .
ENFJ	Religion can be the enemy of God . It 's often what happens when God , like Elvis , has left the building .
ESFP	The major civilizing force in the world is not religion , it is sex .
INFJ	I do not know how to teach philosophy without becoming a disturber of established religion .
ISFJ	I love religion .
ESTJ	9/11 was a deliberate , carefully planned evil act of the long-waged war on the West by Koran-inspired soldiers of Allah around the world . They hated us before George W. Bush was in office . They hated us before Israel existed . And the avengers of the religion of perpetual outrage will keep hating us .
ENFP	If I were asked for a one-sentence sound bite on religion , I would say I was against it .
ENFP	I was 21 in 1968 , so I 'm as much a child of the '60s as is possible to be . In those years the subject of religion had really almost disappeared the idea that religion was going to be a major force in the life of our societies , in the West anyway , would have seemed absurd in 1968 .
ISTJ	Well , right now , I 'm very fascinated with 1920s Berlin . I mean , probably the more interesting thing would be to go to the beginning of civilization or precivilization - like polytheistic times . It would be interesting to see what came before modern religion and culture - what circumstances created the environment or the need for it .
ISTJ	You know , I get much more Jewish in Israel because I like the way that religion is done there .
ESTJ	Twenty five percent of Israeli citizens are not even Jewish . Anybody can become an Israeli citizen if you qualify . Religion is not a criterion for citizenship .
ESFJ	I love it when the left and when the president say , 'Do n't try to impose your values on us , you folks who hold your Bibles in your hand and cling to your guns . ' They have values too . Our values are based on religion , based on life . Their values are based on a religion of self .
ESTJ	When asked if I consider myself Buddhist , the answer is , Not really . But it 's more my religion than any other because I was brought up with it in an intellectual and spiritual environment . I do n't practice or preach it , however .
ESFJ	First of all , the Jewish religion has a great deal in common with the Christian religion because , as Rabbi Gillman points out in the show , Christianity is based on Judaism . Christ was Jewish .
ISFP	It 's fun being in Islamic countries , to know there 's only one religion . There 's order . You wear a burqa . There 's no choice . People are happy with that .
ENFJ	To play June , I had an immediate connect with her background and culture . We grew up with the same religion and shared a lot of the same values of family and spirituality . But I was really so inspired by what a modern woman she was .
ESFJ	I found it interesting that as people become more technically oriented all over the world , at the same time people are becoming increasingly spiritual . The success of the Da Vinci code - even though it was a great yawn - also showed people 's interest in religion .
ESTP	The only difference is that religion is much better organised and has been around much longer , but it 's the same story with different characters and different costumes .
ENFJ	An individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust , and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice , is in reality expressing the highest respect for the law .
INTP	Everyone should be respected as an individual , but no one idolized .
INTP	Let every man be respected as an individual and no man idolized .
ESTP	Be peaceful , be courteous , obey the law , respect everyone but if someone puts his hand on you , send him to the cemetery .
INTP	If once you forfeit the confidence of your fellow-citizens , you can never regain their respect and esteem .
ENFP	When people do not respect us we are sharply offended yet in his private heart no man much respects himself .
INTJ	Go up close to your friend , but do not go over to him ! We should also respect the enemy in our friend .
INFP	I have no right , by anything I do or say , to demean a human being in his own eyes . What matters is not what I think of him it is what he thinks of himself . To undermine a man 's self-respect is a sin .
ENTP	To the living we owe respect , but to the dead we owe only the truth .
ENFJ	To be one , to be united is a great thing . But to respect the right to be different is maybe even greater .
ENFJ	One who breaks an unjust law that conscience tells him is unjust , and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice , is in reality expressing the highest respect for law .
ENFJ	I submit that an individual who breaks the law that conscience tells him is unjust and willingly accepts the penalty by staying in jail to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice , is in reality expressing the very highest respect for law .
ESTP	The British nation is unique in this respect . They are the only people who like to be told how bad things are , who like to be told the worst .
ESTP	We do not covet anything from any nation except their respect .
ENTP	We are more thoroughly an enlightened people , with respect to our political interests , than perhaps any other under heaven . Every man among us reads , and is so easy in his circumstances as to have leisure for conversations of improvement and for acquiring information .
ENTP	One should respect public opinion insofar as is necessary to avoid starvation and keep out of prison , but anything that goes beyond this is voluntary submission to an unnecessary tyranny .
INTP	There may be fairies at the bottom of the garden . There is no evidence for it , but you ca n't prove that there are n't any , so should n't we be agnostic with respect to fairies ?
ISFJ	We reserve our deepest respect and admiration for those who volunteer for service and give their lives to help keep our nation secure .
ESTJ	We learned about gratitude and humility - that so many people had a hand in our success , from the teachers who inspired us to the janitors who kept our school clean ... and we were taught to value everyone 's contribution and treat everyone with respect .
INTJ	I hate victims who respect their executioners .
ENTP	There is no need to worry about mere size . We do not necessarily respect a fat man more than a thin man . Sir Isaac Newton was very much smaller than a hippopotamus , but we do not on that account value him less .
ENTJ	Respect the burden .
ENTP	Against my will , in the course of my travels , the belief that everything worth knowing was known at Cambridge gradually wore off . In this respect my travels were very useful to me .
ISTJ	Find your self-respect now . Do n't dumb yourselves down . Think of yourself as capable and worthy of finding a guy who is going to respect you , too . It 's so important , I mean , and the confidence you get from feeling smart and tackling something like mathematics , which is a challenge , right ? Math is hard .
ESTJ	I , for one , respect those who believe with all their hearts and conscience that there are no circumstances under which any abortion should ever be available .
ESTP	I have more respect for a man who lets me know where he stands , even if he 's wrong . Than the one who comes up like an angel and is nothing but a devil .
ESTP	The Arab League tells us to go in and take out Qaddafi . We 've spent billions of dollars already with respect to the Arab League . Billions of dollars , because they told us to do it . Why are n't they paying for it ? They do n't like Qaddafi , Qaddafi 's been a terrible thorn in their side .
INTP	Respect for right conduct is felt by every body .
ESTP	I love making new friends and I respect people for a lot of different reasons .
ENFP	I 'm an atheist , but I 'm very relaxed about it . I do n't preach my atheism , but I have a huge amount of respect for people like Richard Dawkins who do .
ENFP	I like to be bought flowers and taken out for dinner . I like a man to be a gentleman . I do n't like to be treated as if I am brainless . I like to be respected and to give respect .
ISFP	I do n't believe war is a way to solve problems . I think it 's wrong . I do n't have respect for the people that made the decisions to go on with war . I do n't have that much respect for Bush . He 's about war , I 'm not about war - a lot of people are n't about war .
ENTP	I think every religious person should have a deep sense of respect for other people 's religious documents and religious symbols just as we were deeply opposed to the Taliban destroying the two historic buddhas which they blew up . So I think we ought to all oppose burning the Koran .
INTJ	I do n't envy or much respect people who are completely politicised .
ESTP	When I 'm getting to know someone , I look for someone who has passions that I respect , like his career . Someone who loves what he does is really attractive .
INTJ	I will not speak with disrespect of the Republican Party . I always speak with respect of the past .
ESFJ	To get down to the quick of it , respect motivates me - not success .
ESFJ	What I respect as far as in myself and in others is the spirit of just doing it . For better or worse , it may work and it may not , but I 'm going to go for it . Ultimately I probably prefer to be respected for that than whether it works out or not , either winning or losing .
ESFP	I 'm a good girl because I really believe in love , integrity , and respect .
ISFP	I really do n't spend any time on the Internet , so I guess I live a little under a rock in that respect .
ISFJ	The Masters is where I won my first major , and I view this tournament with great respect . After a long and necessary time away from the game , I feel like I 'm ready to start my season at Augusta .
ISFJ	I will have to earn trust and respect from my kids .
ENTP	I 've always had great respect for Paddington because he is amusingly English and eccentric . He is a great British institution and my generation grew up with the books and then Michael Horden 's animations .
INFP	If I respect myself and believe in what I 'm doing , no one can touch me .
ENFJ	There 's one advantage in having been around as long as I have . Everybody in the Senate knows me , and - I 'm going to say something presumptuous , to repeat myself - I think most respect me .
ESFJ	You totally value and respect your body as you get older .
INTJ	Hip-hop is more about attaining wealth . People respect success . They respect big . They do n't even have to like your music . If you 're big enough , people are drawn to you .
ISFP	I remember I read this harsh review about my show , and one of my friends told me that this was the exact same stuff people said about Madonna . And it 's like , she did n't care . Madonna just came out and was herself . I respect that a lot .
INTJ	I have respect for beer .
INFJ	All due respect and trying to be as modest as I can be , I am a dancer . But I do n't think I would be on 'Dancing with the Stars , ' mainly because I would be too shy .
ISFJ	I know people that I respect and admire and look up to who have had extra-marital affairs .
ENTJ	I think we need to significantly reduce the regulatory burden on the private sector . The Obama administration is doing the opposite . They 're loading on more and more regulation on the private respect to how the economy functions .
ISFP	That 's the most important thing to me - that if I 'm gon na spend however long it takes to make a movie , give up 14 hours a day for however many weeks or months , then it 's very important for me to know that I 'm working with people who I respect and enjoy and that we 're going for something together .
ISTP	I have respect for what other people believe . What I believe in my own life is that it 's a search for how I can do things better , whether it 's being a better man or a better father or finding ways for myself to improve .
ESFJ	I always remember having a healthy respect for my grandmother .
ENFJ	In fact I am quite snappy and irritable , and I do n't know if I 'd like to make myself worse in that respect .
INFJ	I do think that , at one time , being an actress was the equivalent almost of being a prostitute . It garnered roughly the same respect . That 's changed a lot , thank goodness .
INFP	I 'm definitely bicoastal , but I have to say , it 's easier to live in New York than in L.A . I feel like people respect other people 's space a bit more here .
INTJ	I was always fascinated by engineering . Maybe it was an attempt maybe to get my father 's respect or interest , or maybe it was just a genetic love of technology , but I was always trying to build things .
ESTJ	Americans will respect your beliefs if you just keep them private .
ENFP	And they like being able to turn on the television day in and day out to see someone that they know and they feel comfortable with and trust hopefully and respect even .
ESFP	A lot of the time , the way it 's portrayed is that I only see women in a sexual way . But I grew up with just my mum and sister , so I respect women a lot .
ESFJ	I want to be remembered as somebody that tried to respect her integrity as an artist and as a person . And I do n't want to be in any box . I do n't want to be one thing .
ESTJ	You respect all of these people that you know in the business as actors . And they sort of turn around and say , we really like your work . It 's a nice acknowledgment .
ENTP	We 're in such a volatile climate right now politically . I think they did n't want Assassins to not succeed due to popular opinion and politics , versus on its own merits . I can respect that .
ENFP	Deceiving others . That is what the world calls a romance .
ESTJ	The word 'romance , ' according to the dictionary , means excitement , adventure , and something extremely real . Romance should last a lifetime .
INFP	The telephone , which interrupts the most serious conversations and cuts short the most weighty observations , has a romance of its own .
ISTP	I think romance is anything honest . As long as it 's honest , it 's so disarming .
ESTP	Remember , beneath every cynic there lies a romantic , and probably an injured one .
ESTJ	I 'm a feminist , but I think that romance has been taken away a bit for my generation . I think what people connect with in novels is this idea of an overpowering , encompassing love - and it being more important and special than anything and everything else .
ESFP	I believe that when you 're in love you have to pour your heart and soul out to your partner ... or why bother ? So in that sense I 'm an incurable romantic when it comes to men .

ISFJ	I think I 'll always be a hopeless romantic .
ISTJ	I love surprises - champagne and strawberries , all that pampering , romantic stuff . Guys ought to know how to pamper their women properly .
ENTP	If a man lets all of my dogs sleep in the bed with us , then that is the most romantic thing . You must love my dogs in order to love me . A man who is nice to my animals and does n't shoo them away - well , that 's the height of romance .
ENFJ	I do n't get off on romantic parts . But I often think if I had had my dental work done early on , well , maybe .
ESTJ	I 'm very romantic and of course I want to be in love .
ENFJ	I joined the air force . I took to it immediately when I arrived there . I did three years , eight months , and ten days in all , but it took me a year and a half to get disabused of my romantic notions about it .
ENFJ	I have never acted he has never been cast in a romantic lead or has been cast opposite a female love interest in any movie he starred in .
ISFJ	I want to do the romantic comedies . You know , the stuff that Meg Ryan and Julia Roberts or Reese Witherspoon would choose , of course .
ENFP	Usually comedy is only available to us ladies in the romantic comedy . That 's why I hate romantic comedies .
ENFP	I think in general , romantic comedies tend to take one person 's point of view , but every once in a while you get something that is balanced for two people .
ISFP	If I eat a huge meal and I can get the girl to rub my belly , I think that 's about as romantic as I can think of .
ENTP	My new movie , Fools Rush In , is a romantic comedy and the girl I play in that is very warm , very sweet .

ISTP	The only thing I would unequivocally say is that I have never had any interest in romantic comedy I just could n't do it . I think I 'd be terrible .
ISFJ	I am a hopeless romantic . And I wo n't stop till I get it right .
ISFJ	Even actresses that you really admire , like Reese Witherspoon , you think , 'Another romantic comedy ? ' You see her in something like 'Walk the Line ' and think , 'God , you 're so great ! ' And then you think , 'Why is she doing these stupid romantic comedies ? ' But of course , it 's for money and status .
INFP	I 've always been attracted to romantic secondhand clothes . But my style developed as I started going to these strange raves where everybody had these very definitive costumes .
ESFP	I 'm probably a bit romantic about it , but I think we humans miss having contact with fire . We need it .

INFJ	If I were given a choice between two films and one was dark and explored depraved , troubled or sick aspects of our culture , I would always opt for that over the next romantic comedy .
ESFP	I 'm better with my hands , and I always loved the slightly romantic idea of starting with bits of wood and being able to create something to sit on , to eat from , to store your clothes in .
ENFP	My music is bejewelled , it 's colourful , it 's romantic , it shines .
ENTP	I 'm the first one who sees every romantic comedy in theaters .
ISTP	Mind you , Roman Holiday - which is kind of a romantic comedy - is one of my favorite films , and I think Audrey Hepburn is absolutely phenomenal in that movie .
ESTJ	I 'd like to classify my life as a romantic comedy . Unfortunately I feel it 's probably more like a TV reality show .
INFJ	For a romantic comedy to be three hours long , that 's longer than most marriages .
ENTP	The reason I turn down 99 % of a hundred , I mean a thousand , scripts is because romantic comedies are often very romantic but seldom very funny .
ISFJ	You wo n't find me in a romantic comedy . Those movies do n't speak to me . People do n't come to talk to me about those scripts , because they probably think I 'm this dark , twisted , miserable person .
ENFP	Participate joyfully in the sorrows of the world . We can not cure the world of sorrows , but we can choose to live in joy .
ISFP	And I remember going to the record studio and there was a park across the street and I 'd see all the children playing and I would cry because it would make me sad that I would have to work instead .
INTP	Is n't it sad to go to your grave without ever wondering why you were born ? Who , with such a thought , would not spring from bed , eager to resume discovering the world and rejoicing to be part of it ?
INFP	Can I see another 's woe , and not be in sorrow too ? Can I see another 's grief , and not seek for kind relief ?
ENFP	I was raised in an atmosphere of 'everything 's fine . ' But as I got older , I was like , 'Well no , everything 's not fine . There is stuff that 's sad . ' I am a really sensitive person . I think I am too sensitive sometimes .
INTP	When I seemed to be irritable or sad , my father would quote the learned Dr. Knight , and then say , 'Just go to sleep . ' Like all smart aleck kids , I thought the advice was silly . But as I 've grown older , I 've realized just how smart Knight was .
ENFP	My parents ' divorce left me with a lot of sadness and pain and acting , and especially humour , was my way of dealing with all that .

ENFP	It is a very sad thing that nowadays there is so little useless information .

ENTP	He who is not just is severe , he who is not wise is sad .

INFJ	The sad souls of those who lived without blame and without praise .
ENFJ	Sometimes I wonder if suicides are n't in fact sad guardians of the meaning of life .

ENFJ	I was sad that Corpse Bride was so short . I would 've liked to have had her around for way longer . She does n't actually have that many scenes .
ISTP	Being on your own would be sad , sick and weird . I do n't trust myself . I need that balance .
ISTP	The sad thing is that I feel so boring because 'Twilight ' is literally how every conversation I have these days begins - whether it 's someone I 'm meeting for the first time or someone I just have n't seen in a while . The first thing I want to say to them is , 'It 's insane ! And , as a person , I ca n't do anything ! '
ISTP	I 've got to be high class ... Which is sad , because I like bars .
ENTJ	We 're sad about some of the losses of members of great seniority and distinction in the Congress , and some very new members , who will no longer be serving with us .

ENTP	Apart from the fact that your physical ability starts to decline , I also think someone in their fifties being childlike becomes a little sad . You 've got to be careful .

ENTP	Atari is a very sad story .
ESFP	You 've got a beautiful country with so many beautiful people and so many beautiful things happening and stuff like that lets it down . I feel sad for them .
ENFJ	I never get scared making these kinds of movies because it 's all make-believe , but I did cry when I saw the finished version of Man On Fire because it is so sad .
ENFJ	The hardest thing is at the end you have to say bye to all these people who you have worked with for so many months . It was really sad not to see them anymore . But you have the parties that you go to and you get to see them , like the premieres and the screenings .
ENFJ	No not really , it is just like real life . Not everyday you are happy and not everyday you are sad .
INFP	One of the sad things about contemporary journalism is that it actually matters very little . The world now is almost inured to the power of journalism . The best journalism would manage to outrage people . And people are less and less inclined to outrage .
INTP	Only two things are infinite , the universe and human stupidity , and I 'm not sure about the former .
INTP	No amount of experimentation can ever prove me right a single experiment can prove me wrong .
INTP	Each problem that I solved became a rule , which served afterwards to solve other problems .
INFJ	Your theory is crazy , but it 's not crazy enough to be true .
INTJ	There is a single light of science , and to brighten it anywhere is to brighten it everywhere .
INTP	Adventure upon all the tickets in the lottery , and you lose for certain and the greater the number of your tickets the nearer your approach to this certainty .
ESTP	We seem to have a compulsion these days to bury time capsules in order to give those people living in the next century or so some idea of what we are like .
INTP	Science is a wonderful thing if one does not have to earn one 's living at it .
INTP	The grand aim of all science is to cover the greatest number of empirical facts by logical deduction from the smallest number of hypotheses or axioms .
INTP	Most of the fundamental ideas of science are essentially simple , and may , as a rule , be expressed in a language comprehensible to everyone .
INTP	The whole of science is nothing more than a refinement of everyday thinking .
INTP	The man of science is a poor philosopher .
ENFP	Success is a science if you have the conditions , you get the result .
ENFP	Romance should never begin with sentiment . It should begin with science and end with a settlement .
ESFP	Let both sides seek to invoke the wonders of science instead of its terrors . Together let us explore the stars , conquer the deserts , eradicate disease , tap the ocean depths , and encourage the arts and commerce .
ENTJ	We live in a society exquisitely dependent on science and technology , in which hardly anyone knows anything about science and technology .
INTJ	Individual science fiction stories may seem as trivial as ever to the blinder critics and philosophers of today - but the core of science fiction , its essence has become crucial to our salvation if we are to be saved at all .
ENTJ	If we long to believe that the stars rise and set for us , that we are the reason there is a Universe , does science do us a disservice in deflating our conceits ?
ISTP	When I die , I 'm leaving my body to science fiction .
ENTP	Science is what you know , philosophy is what you do n't know .
INTP	It has become almost a cliche to remark that nobody boasts of ignorance of literature , but it is socially acceptable to boast ignorance of science and proudly claim incompetence in mathematics .
ENFP	Science has explained nothing the more we know the more fantastic the world becomes and the profounder the surrounding darkness .
ENTJ	I have seen firsthand that agricultural science has enormous potential to increase the yields of small farmers and lift them out of hunger and poverty .
INTP	False facts are highly injurious to the progress of science , for they often endure long but false views , if supported by some evidence , do little harm , for every one takes a salutary pleasure in proving their falseness .
ENFP	Specialized meaninglessness has come to be regarded , in certain circles , as a kind of hallmark of true science .
ENTJ	We 've arranged a civilization in which most crucial elements profoundly depend on science and technology .
INTJ	Time travel used to be thought of as just science fiction , but Einstein 's general theory of relativity allows for the possibility that we could warp space-time so much that you could go off in a rocket and return before you set out .
INTJ	The product of mental labor - science - always stands far below its value , because the labor-time necessary to reproduce it has no relation at all to the labor-time required for its original production .
ENTP	Almost everything that distinguishes the modern world from earlier centuries is attributable to science , which achieved its most spectacular triumphs in the seventeenth century .
INTJ	Natural science will in time incorporate into itself the science of man , just as the science of man will incorporate into itself natural science : there will be one science .
INTP	I am one of those scientists who feels that it is no longer enough just to get on and do science . We have to devote a significant proportion of our time and resources to defending it from deliberate attack from organised ignorance .
INTP	The enlightenment is under threat . So is reason . So is truth . So is science , especially in the schools of America .
INTJ	The usual approach of science of constructing a mathematical model can not answer the questions of why there should be a universe for the model to describe . Why does the universe go to all the bother of existing ?
INTJ	Science is not only a disciple of reason but , also , one of romance and passion .
INTJ	Science fiction writers foresee the inevitable , and although problems and catastrophes may be inevitable , solutions are not .
INTJ	The universe is governed by science . But science tells us that we ca n't solve the equations , directly in the abstract .
INTP	Of course in science there are things that are open to doubt and things need to be discussed . But among the things that science does know , evolution is about as certain as anything we know .
INTJ	To me there has never been a higher source of earthly honor or distinction than that connected with advances in science .
INTJ	Science predicts that many different kinds of universe will be spontaneously created out of nothing . It is a matter of chance which we are in .

INTJ	Philosophers have not kept up with modern developments in science . Particularly physics .
INTJ	The media need superheroes in science just as in every sphere of life , but there is really a continuous range of abilities with no clear dividing line .
INTJ	I used to think information was destroyed in black hole . This was my biggest blunder , or at least my biggest blunder in science .
INTP	Science coverage could be improved by the recognition that science is timeless , and therefore science stories should not need to be pegged to an item in the news .
INTJ	The method of political science is the interpretation of life its instrument is insight , a nice understanding of subtle , unformulated conditions .
ESFP	Traditional science assumes , for the most part , that an objective observer independent reality exists the universe , stars , galaxies , sun , moon and earth would still be there if no one was looking .
ESFP	We must revisit the idea that science is a methodology and not an ontology .
ESFP	I want to be the Cecil B. DeMille of science fiction .
INTP	In science , we must be interested in things , not in persons .
INFP	That 's the whole problem with science . You 've got a bunch of empiricists trying to describe things of unimaginable wonder .
INFJ	Man has to awaken to wonder - and so perhaps do peoples . Science is a way of sending him to sleep again .
INTP	After all , science is essentially international , and it is only through lack of the historical sense that national qualities have been attributed to it .
INFJ	As soon as questions of will or decision or reason or choice of action arise , human science is at a loss .
ISTJ	Millions of people were inspired by the Apollo Program . I was five years old when I watched Apollo 11 unfold on television , and without any doubt it was a big contributor to my passions for science , engineering , and exploration .
ENTJ	The science linking the increased frequency and severity of extreme weather to the climate crisis has matured tremendously in the last couple of years .
ENTP	The violent reaction on the recent development of modern physics can only be understood when one realises that here the foundations of physics have started moving and that this motion has caused the feeling that the ground would be cut from science .
ISTP	'Rocket Science ' is really where I fell in love with filmmaking , I think 'Camp ' was incredible , but it was so bizarre , and I was trying to find my footing in this world where you do n't have an audience for immediate validation .
ENTP	Teachers started recognizing me and praising me for being smart in science and that made me want to be even smarter in science !
INTJ	I had read tons of science fiction . I was fascinated by other worlds , other environments . For me , it was fantasy , but it was not fantasy in the sense of pure escapism .
INTP	I do n't really see science fiction as fiction . I can imagine colonies on Mars and everything .
ENTP	I was a daydreamer , and there is a lot of history and geography and science I missed out on because I was in my head . And I regret that .
ENTP	Science may be described as the art of systematic over-simplification .
ENTP	Science must begin with myths , and with the criticism of myths .
ENTP	In the spirit of science , there really is no such thing as a 'failed experiment . ' Any test that yields valid data is a valid test .
ENTP	That 's the show . it 's like 5 minutes of science and then 10 minutes of me hurting myself .
ENTP	We did n't set out to be educators or even scientists , and we do n't purport that what we do is real science but we 're demonstrating a methodology by which one can engage and satisfy your curiosity .
ENTP	In some parts of life , like mathematics and science , yeah , I was a genius . I would top all the top scores you could ever measure it by .
ISFP	There 's a lot of interesting words , nomenclatures , in science .
INTP	One of the reasons I did this , because I was n't really looking for another science fiction film , was that my daughter can see it . She 's 9 and it 's really a good film for all ages .
INTJ	I felt that chess ... is a science in the form of a game ... I consider myself a scientist . I wanted to be treated like a scientist .
ESFJ	If you smile when no one else is around , you really mean it .
ESTP	War is a game that is played with a smile . If you ca n't smile , grin . If you ca n't grin , keep out of the way till you can .
ENFP	You know , I 've got wrinkles on my forehead and smile lines , but what 's wrong with that ? I love to smile .
ISFP	I do n't mind a little Sturm und Drang . When I was doing 'Riding in Cars With Boys , ' I would n't smile at anybody , because my character , Bev , was angry at the world . I 'm the opposite . Inside my head I 'd be like , God , I 'll explain to you at the end of shooting that I 'm not this person .
ESFJ	Later in my life , I 'm going to look back and smile and be very fulfilled . I know that if I do n't give it my all right now I 'll regret it later . That 's very important to me , because I 've worked all my life to have this .
ISFP	I was walking around legally blind . Now I have 20-20 vision . I ca n't believe I spent so many years blurry , but I think that coincides with how I was feeling . Now I notice if people are watching me , but I also smile right back if someone waves , which helps .
ESFP	Crowds are the most difficult thing for me these days because I have to walk with my head down and my eyes averted . There 's still that part of me that wants to hold my head up , make eye contact and smile .
INFP	When you 're walking down the street , or you 're at a restaurant , someone catches your eye because they have their own look . It goes way beyond what they 're wearing - into their mannerisms , the way they smile , or just the way they hold themselves .
ISTJ	A people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both .
INTP	We have a system that increasingly taxes work and subsidizes nonwork .
INTP	No society can surely be flourishing and happy , of which the far greater part of the members are poor and miserable .
INFP	Society has always seemed to demand a little more from human beings than it will get in practice .
ESFP	We must reject the idea that every time a law 's broken , society is guilty rather than the lawbreaker . It is time to restore the American precept that each individual is accountable for his actions .
INFP	Our society is run by insane people for insane objectives . I think we 're being run by maniacs for maniacal ends and I think I 'm liable to be put away as insane for expressing that . That 's what 's insane about it .
ENFJ	Discrimination is a hellhound that gnaws at Negroes in every waking moment of their lives to remind them that the lie of their inferiority is accepted as truth in the society dominating them .
INTP	All that is valuable in human society depends upon the opportunity for development accorded the individual .
ENFJ	It is incontestable and deplorable that Negroes have committed crimes but they are derivative crimes . They are born of the greater crimes of the white society .
ESFP	If a free society can not help the many who are poor , it can not save the few who are rich .
ENFP	Clothes make the man . Naked people have little or no influence on society .
ENFP	In a closed society where everybody 's guilty , the only crime is getting caught . In a world of thieves , the only final sin is stupidity .
ENFP	The finest clothing made is a person 's own skin , but , of course , society demands something more than this .
ESFP	The very word 'secrecy ' is repugnant in a free and open society and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies , to secret oaths , and to secret proceedings .
INFJ	I know of no safe depository of the ultimate powers of the society but the people themselves and if we think them not enlightened enough to exercise their control with a wholesome discretion , the remedy is not to take it from them but to inform their discretion .
INFJ	Truth is certainly a branch of morality and a very important one to society .
INFJ	I claim that human mind or human society is not divided into watertight compartments called social , political and religious . All act and react upon one another .
ENFP	If one could only teach the English how to talk , and the Irish how to listen , society here would be quite civilized .
ENFP	Society exists only as a mental concept in the real world there are only individuals .
INFP	My role in society , or any artist 's or poet 's role , is to try and express what we all feel . Not to tell people how to feel . Not as a preacher , not as a leader , but as a reflection of us all .
ESTP	To educate a man in mind and not in morals is to educate a menace to society .
ENFP	I suppose society is wonderfully delightful . To be in it is merely a bore . But to be out of it is simply a tragedy .
INFP	The basic thing nobody asks is why do people take drugs of any sort ? Why do we have these accessories to normal living to live ? I mean , is there something wrong with society that 's making us so pressurized , that we can not live without guarding ourselves against it ?
ENFJ	There can be no keener revelation of a society 's soul than the way in which it treats its children .
INFP	The society based on production is only productive , not creative .
ENFJ	I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities .
ENFJ	I should tie myself to no particular system of society other than of socialism .
ISTP	Crimes against children are the most heinous crime . That , for me , would be a reason for capital punishment because children are innocent and need the guidance of an adult society .
ISTJ	The smarter the journalists are , the better off society is . For to a degree , people read the press to inform themselves - and the better the teacher , the better the student body .
ENTP	In December , I agreed to extend the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans because it was the only way I could prevent a tax hike on middle-class Americans . But we can not afford $ 1 trillion worth of tax cuts for every millionaire and billionaire in our society . We ca n't afford it . And I refuse to renew them again .
INFJ	We live in a society of victimization , where people are much more comfortable being victimized than actually standing up for themselves .
INTJ	Individual rights are the means of subordinating society to moral law .
ENTP	Society therefore is an ancient as the world .
INTJ	In a higher phase of communist society ... only then can the narrow horizon of bourgeois right be fully left behind and society inscribe on its banners : from each according to his ability , to each according to his needs .
ENTP	Princes and governments are far more dangerous than other elements within society .
ESTP	We are trying to construct a more inclusive society . We are going to make a country in which no one is left out .
ENTJ	Although I do n't have a prescription for what others should do , I know I have been very fortunate and feel a responsibility to give back to society in a very significant way .
ISTP	Society is at odds with itself .
ISTP	Our modern society - especially in the West , and especially now - reveres youth .
ISFJ	I will spend the next four years rebuilding the foundation of a opportunity society led by free people and free enterprises .
ISTP	The most important element of a free society , where individual rights are held in the highest esteem , is the rejection of the initiation of violence .
INTJ	In bourgeois society capital is independent and has individuality , while the living person is dependent and has no individuality .
ENTJ	A first-generation fortune is the most likely to be given away , but once a fortune is inherited it 's less likely that a very high percentage will go back to society .
ENTJ	I think the first duty of society is justice .
INTJ	Society does not consist of individuals but expresses the sum of interrelations , the relations within which these individuals stand .
INTJ	When I read about the way in which library funds are being cut and cut , I can only think that American society has found one more way to destroy itself .
INTJ	In our society , the women who break down barriers are those who ignore limits .
INTJ	The ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas , i.e. , the class which is the ruling material force of society , is at the same time its ruling intellectual force .
INTJ	The human being is in the most literal sense a political animal , not merely a gregarious animal , but an animal which can individuate itself only in the midst of society .
ENTP	Society can overlook murder , adultery or swindling it never forgives preaching of a new gospel .
INTP	Well first of all , tell me , is there some society you know of that does n't run on greed ? You think Russia does n't run on greed ? You think China does n't run on greed ? What is greed ?
ENTP	Nobility is a graceful ornament to the civil order . It is the Corinthian capital of polished society .
ESFJ	What you 're seeing with Occupy Wall Street and the others are people who are unhappy and they 're directing their unhappiness now toward Wall Street and toward those they think are doing too well in our society .
INFJ	Society cares for the individual only so far as he is profitable .
ESTP	I believe we can continue the Great Society while we fight in Vietnam .
INTP	The reason why men enter into society is the preservation of their property .
ENTP	The individual is not accountable to society for his actions in so far as these concern the interests of no person but himself .
ENTP	The only part of the conduct of any one , for which he is amenable to society , is that which concerns others . In the part which merely concerns himself , his independence is , of right , absolute . Over himself , over his own body and mind , the individual is sovereign .
ESFP	Once the fabric of a just society is undone , it takes generations to weave it back together .
ENFP	A society that has more justice is a society that needs less charity .
INFJ	Society , being codified by man , decrees that woman is inferior she can do away with this inferiority only by destroying the male 's superiority .
ESTP	To conclude that women are unfitted to the task of our historic society seems to me the equivalent of closing male eyes to female facts .
ESFJ	All the United States , it is a society that is split like to the bottom , that had very poor people in the country that is one of the wealthiest countries .
INTP	If we try to engineer outcomes , if we overturn tradition to make everyone the same , we ruin society . If we upset tradition to allow for an equal shot at the starting gate , everyone wins , except for the charlatans and would be dictators .
INTJ	If you look at any Muslim society and you make a scale of how developed they are , and how successful the economy is , it 's a straight line . It depends on how much they emancipate their women .
ESTP	We have the opportunity to move not only toward the rich society and the powerful society , but upward to the Great Society .
ENFP	Ironing boards are a classic example of something I find horrible about modern society : the excitementation , for want of a better word , of mundane things .
ENFJ	For too long in this society , we have celebrated unrestrained individualism over common community .
ENTJ	We live in an image society . Speeches are not what anybody cares about what they care about is the picture .
ESFJ	The runway symbolizes something in society that 's very intimidating to women .
ENTJ	I ca n't imagine what it is like to be raised in a society where their only statues that exist are to you and your father .
ESFJ	Without intervention today , the cost of care for adults with autism will be significantly greater and the burden will no longer lie with the parents , but on our entire society .
ISFP	The true meaning of feminism is this : to use your strong womanly image to gain strong results in society .
INTJ	No one has done a study on this , as far as I can tell , but I think Facebook might be the first place where a large number of people have come out . We did n't create that - society was generally ready for that . I think this is just part of the general trend that we talked about , about society being more open , and I think that 's good .
INFJ	I do earnestly wish to see the distinction of sex confounded in society , unless where love animates the behaviour .
ESFJ	What is missing from today 's dialogue is the effect autism is having on families , our society and what the unknown factors are . The 300lb . gorilla in the room is that our children with autism today will soon become adults with autism .
ISTJ	I want to help middle-school girls stay interested in math and be good at it , and see it as friendly and accessible and not this scary thing . Everyone else in society tells them it 's not for them . It 's for nerdy white guys with pocket protectors .
ENFJ	The devastating punch we took on September 11th still reverberates throughout American society .
ENFJ	We must rekindle the fire of idealism in our society .
ISFJ	It 's not fair that women look in the mirror and feel disgust because of what society has made them believe .
ESFP	If you let society and your peers define who you are , you 're the less for it .
ENFP	The only way of living in a free society is to feel that you have the right to say and do stuff .
ENFP	The response of anybody interested in liberty is that we all have a say and the ability to have an argument is exactly what liberty is , even though it may never be resolved . In any authoritarian society the possessor of power dictates , and if you try and step outside he will come after you .
INTP	My definition of a decent society is one that first of all takes care of its losers , and protects its weak .
INTP	If you ask an economist what 's driven economic growth , it 's been major advances in things that mattered - the mechanization of farming , mass manufacturing , things like that . The problem is , our society is not organized around doing that .
ENTP	But , actually , so many of the clerics that I 've met , particularly the Church of England clerics , are people of such extraordinary smugness and arrogance and conceitedness who are extraordinarily presumptuous about the significance of their position in society .
ESTJ	AIDS is not just God 's punishment for homosexuals it is God 's punishment for the society that tolerates homosexuals .
ISTJ	Standards of conduct appropriate to civil society or the workings of a democracy can not be purely and simply applied to the Church .
ENTJ	What does Burma have to give the United States ? We can give you the opportunity to engage with people who are ready and willing to change a society .
ESTJ	But the truth of the matter is , we 're an open society , we want to remain an open society , and there will continue to be vulnerability . That 's why we have to meet the threats when they are not yet taking place on our territory and on our soil .
INTJ	I have , in some ways , saved characters that have been marginalized by society by playing them - and having them still have dignity and still survive , still get through it .
ENFJ	America must be the teacher of democracy , not the advertiser of the consumer society . It is unrealistic for the rest of the world to reach the American living standard .
ESTP	Sometimes nudity is gratuitous . We just live in a society where everything goes .
ENFP	You forget that you do choose your life and there are so many things to be grateful for and I feel like society has gotten to that point where we 're always looking for the next and the better and we lose sight of what 's actually in front of us .
ENFJ	As you have fewer and fewer voices in a democracy , in a free society , it 's not good to limit the number of voices .
ENFP	When the going gets weird , the weird turn pro .
ESTJ	The only time my prayers are never answered is on the golf course .
INTJ	Golf is a game in which one endeavors to control a ball with implements ill adapted for the purpose .
ISFP	If your man is a sports enthusiast , you may have to resign yourself to his spouting off in a monotone on a prize fight , football game or pennant race .
ENTJ	Even if I did have , you know , a 'Sports Illustrated ' body , I 'd still wear elegant clothes .
ESFJ	I enjoy sports in person .
ENTP	I was always a sports nut but I 've lost interest now in whether one bunch of mercenaries in north London is going to beat another bunch of mercenaries from west London .
INFJ	I am very slow to warm . I 've always been sort of a loner . I did n't play team sports . I am better one-on-one than in big groups .
ISFP	I grew up being into sports and I was n't trained to move my body in the right way for dancing . I 'm the last one to get any moves correct . In rehearsals it 's always , 'OK , one more take for Zac . '
INTP	I have zero interest in sports of any kind - professional , college or international .
ISTJ	It certainly is dangerous that there are only a few clubs left in Europe that can afford to pay millions . At the end of the day however , the spectators decide the rates of pay - by watching the games and consuming the goods and services advertised on sports TV programmes .
ESFJ	If they asked me , I did two shifts . I did sports , I did news , because I loved it .
ISTP	I love sport , I grew up playing sports , that 's all I did , and it is so invigorating now that I 'm supposedly adult to learn something completely new , from the bottom up .
ISTP	I grew up playing sports , but now I feel like I ca n't , because if I get injured , I 'll impair whatever film I 'm working on .
ESFJ	The sports page records people 's accomplishments , the front page usually records nothing , but man 's failures .
ESTP	Everyone I know who is successful has issues with their father , regardless of whether it was sports or business or entertainment .
INTJ	I hate ready-made suits , button-down collars , and sports shirts .
ISFJ	I always loved the way music made me feel . I did sports at school and all , but when I got home , it was just music . Everybody in my neighborhood loved music . I could jump the back fence and be in the park where there were ghetto blasters everywhere .
INTJ	That which does not kill us makes us stronger .
ESTP	The world breaks everyone , and afterward , some are strong at the broken places .
INTJ	Strength does not come from winning . Your struggles develop your strengths . When you go through hardships and decide not to surrender , that is strength .
INTP	Only one who devotes himself to a cause with his whole strength and soul can be a true master . For this reason mastery demands all of a person .
ENFJ	Where there is no struggle , there is no strength .
ENFJ	Does anybody really think that they did n't get what they had because they did n't have the talent or the strength or the endurance or the commitment ?
ISTJ	Do n't expect to build up the weak by pulling down the strong .
ISFJ	Because your own strength is unequal to the task , do not assume that it is beyond the powers of man but if anything is within the powers and province of man , believe that it is within your own compass also .
ISFJ	In all my perplexities and distresses , the Bible has never failed to give me light and strength .
ENTP	What is important is to believe in something so strongly that you 're never discouraged .
INFJ	Strength does not come from physical capacity . It comes from an indomitable will .
ESFP	The tax on capital gains directly affects investment decisions , the mobility and flow of risk capital ... the ease or difficulty experienced by new ventures in obtaining capital , and thereby the strength and potential for growth in the economy .
INFJ	It is my own firm belief that the strength of the soul grows in proportion as you subdue the flesh .
INFJ	When restraint and courtesy are added to strength , the latter becomes irresistible .
ESTP	A nation that destroys its soils destroys itself . Forests are the lungs of our land , purifying the air and giving fresh strength to our people .
ESTJ	Tears shed for self are tears of weakness , but tears shed for others are a sign of strength .
ISFJ	Ronald Reagan was a president of strength . His philosophy was a philosophy of strength - a strong military , a strong economy and strong families .
ENTJ	My greatest strength is common sense . I 'm really a standard brand - like Campbell 's tomato soup or Baker 's chocolate .
ISTJ	The spirit of man is more important than mere physical strength , and the spiritual fiber of a nation than its wealth .
ISTJ	Only strength can cooperate . Weakness can only beg .
ISTJ	Our real problem , then , is not our strength today it is rather the vital necessity of action today to ensure our strength tomorrow .
ESTP	The financial crisis should not become an excuse to raise taxes , which would only undermine the economic growth required to regain our strength .
ESTP	The men who have guided the destiny of the United States have found the strength for their tasks by going to their knees . This private unity of public men and their God is an enduring source of reassurance for the people of America .
ESTP	Lust is to the other passions what the nervous fluid is to life it supports them all , lends strength to them all ambition , cruelty , avarice , revenge , are all founded on lust .
ESFJ	You really have to look inside yourself and find your own inner strength , and say , 'I 'm proud of what I am and who I am , and I 'm just going to be myself . '
ENTJ	I think that we had a different view of what the 21st century could be like , with much more of a sense , from our perspective , of trying to have an interdependent world : looking at solving regional conflicts , having strength in alliances , operating within some kind of a sense that we were part of the international community and not outside of it .
ESFJ	I have arm-wrestled here and there ... guys seem to want to test my strength .
INFJ	Women have seldom sufficient employment to silence their feelings a round of little cares , or vain pursuits frittering away all strength of mind and organs , they become naturally only objects of sense .
INFP	I do a dance-based cardio workout infused with circuit training , and emphasizing strength and alignment .
ENTJ	I know what my limitations are as an actor , but my strength is putting myself into a well-written part . When I get in trouble is when I have to fix it , or when I have to carry it on personality .
ISTJ	So Europe needs to be competitive and we also need to be competitive if we wish to remain an interesting economic partner for the United States . This has to be done on the basis of strength , of competitiveness .
ESTJ	Nothing symbolizes American strength and vigor more than another unaccountable Washington bureaucrat .
ENFP	Military preparedness is absolutely a form of strength .
ISFJ	On set is where I feel comfortable . The red carpet stuff , talking about the film , explaining your own life , it does n't come naturally . It 's all necessary stuff I suppose but it 's not my strength .
ESFJ	I think my best skill in this whole deal is as a conduit to try to bring people together , because I think it 's in our unity that we 'll have the greatest strength .
ISFJ	It 's funny , because in drama school , my greatest strength was my range . So my early career was like that : I played all kinds of different characters .
INTP	Try not to become a man of success , but rather try to become a man of value .
INTP	Always bear in mind that your own resolution to succeed is more important than any other .
ESTJ	Coming together is a beginning keeping together is progress working together is success .
INTP	Strive not to be a success , but rather to be of value .
ENFP	All you need is ignorance and confidence and the success is sure .
ENTJ	Success is a lousy teacher . It seduces smart people into thinking they ca n't lose .
ENTJ	What is success ? I think it is a mixture of having a flair for the thing that you are doing knowing that it is not enough , that you have got to have hard work and a certain sense of purpose .
ESTP	I do n't measure a man 's success by how high he climbs but how high he bounces when he hits bottom .
ENFP	A person with a new idea is a crank until the idea succeeds .
ESTP	The most important single ingredient in the formula of success is knowing how to get along with people .
ESTJ	If everyone is moving forward together , then success takes care of itself .
ESTP	If you have no critics you 'll likely have no success .
ESTP	The successful man will profit from his mistakes and try again in a different way .
ESTP	Flaming enthusiasm , backed up by horse sense and persistence , is the quality that most frequently makes for success .
ISTP	Eighty percent of success is showing up .
ESTP	Success is how high you bounce when you hit bottom .
ESFJ	Those who have succeeded at anything and do n't mention luck are kidding themselves .
ESFP	We should measure welfare 's success by how many people leave welfare , not by how many are added .
ENTP	Without continual growth and progress , such words as improvement , achievement , and success have no meaning .
ENTP	Applause waits on success .
ISFP	Success makes so many people hate you . I wish it was n't that way . It would be wonderful to enjoy success without seeing envy in the eyes of those around you .
ISTJ	Discipline is the soul of an army . It makes small numbers formidable procures success to the weak , and esteem to all .
ESTJ	If there is any one secret of success , it lies in the ability to get the other person 's point of view and see things from that person 's angle as well as from your own .
ESTP	The test of success is not what you do when you are on top . Success is how high you bounce when you hit bottom .
ESTJ	Before everything else , getting ready is the secret of success .
ESTP	For unflagging interest and enjoyment , a household of children , if things go reasonably well , certainly all other forms of success and achievement lose their importance by comparison .
ESFP	The path to success is to take massive , determined action .
ISTJ	America is the most grandiose experiment the world has seen , but , I am afraid , it is not going to be a success .
ENTP	There is nothing more difficult to take in hand , more perilous to conduct , or more uncertain in its success , than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things .
ESFP	There 's no abiding success without commitment .
ENTJ	If you wish to be a success in the world , promise everything , deliver nothing .
ENFJ	You know you are on the road to success if you would do your job , and not be paid for it .
ISFJ	I stand ready to lead us down a different path where we 're lifted up by our desire to succeed , not dragged down by a resentment of success .
ESTP	If you have a success you have it for the wrong reasons . If you become popular it is always because of the worst aspects of your work .
ISFJ	Forward , as occasion offers . Never look round to see whether any shall note it ... Be satisfied with success in even the smallest matter , and think that even such a result is no trifle .
ESTP	You never achieve success unless you like what you are doing .
INFP	You do the work and you want people to see it but , um while I 'm doing the work , the result does n't matter at all to me . Ultimately , I do n't , I do n't care whether the film is - you know - some big giant box-office bonanza and I do n't care if its a complete flop . To me , when a film gets made and it 's actually finished it 's a success . They 're all a success in their own way .
ESFJ	There is little success where there is little laughter .
ISFJ	If we become one of those societies that attack success , why not come as certain there will be a lot less success ? And that 's not who we are .
ENTJ	In inner-city , low-income communities of color , there 's such a high correlation in terms of educational quality and success .
ENTJ	Well I think any author or musician is anxious to have legitimate sales of their products , partly so they 're rewarded for their success , partly so they can go on and do new things .
ISTJ	If a man has been his mother 's undisputed darling he retains throughout life the triumphant feeling , the confidence in success , which not seldom brings actual success along with it .
ISTJ	If I had permitted my failures , or what seemed to me at the time a lack of success , to discourage me I can not see any way in which I would ever have made progress .
ESFJ	Success can make you go one of two ways . It can make you a prima donna - or it can smooth the edges , take away the insecurities , let the nice things come out .
ESTJ	Whether you come from a council estate or a country estate , your success will be determined by your own confidence and fortitude .
ISTP	Be yourself . Follow your instincts . Success depends , at least in part , on the ability to 'carry it off . '
ENTJ	I 've learned that mistakes can often be as good a teacher as success .
INTJ	The decadent international but individualistic capitalism in the hands of which we found ourselves after the war is not a success . It is not intelligent . It is not beautiful . It is not just . It is not virtuous . And it does n't deliver the goods .
ISFP	Success is a beast . And it actually puts the emphasis on the wrong thing . You get away with more instead of looking within .
ENFP	While I was doing stand-up , I thought I knew for sure that success meant getting everyone to like me . So I became whoever I thought people wanted me to be . I 'd say yes when I wanted to say no , and I even wore a few dresses .
INFJ	When I finish a picture I do n't show it to anyone if I feel it 's not good enough yet . I 've learnt to listen to my partners and my friends . For me it 's the biggest success if they like it .
ESTP	The more defects a man may have , the older he is , the less lovable , the more resounding his success .
ESTJ	Success is only meaningful and enjoyable if it feels like your own .
ISFP	I hate the idea of success robbing you of your private life .
ESFJ	Think of yourself as on the threshold of unparalleled success . A whole , clear , glorious life lies before you . Achieve ! Achieve !
ESTP	Our purpose in Vietnam is to prevent the success of aggression . It is not conquest , it is not empire , it is not foreign bases , it is not domination . It is , simply put , just to prevent the forceful conquest of South Vietnam by North Vietnam .
ESTJ	Like so many American families , our families were n't asking for much . They did n't begrudge anyone else 's success or care that others had much more than they did ... in fact , they admired it .
ENFP	In the United States there 's a Puritan ethic and a mythology of success . He who is successful is good . In Latin countries , in Catholic countries , a successful person is a sinner .
ISFP	When success comes , people can try to trick you or take advantage of you .
INTP	Personal relationships are the fertile soil from which all advancement , all success , all achievement in real life grows .
INFJ	Success is survival .
ISFJ	Hopefully I 'll continue to have the success I 've had .
ISFJ	The thing you do n't dream about as a kid is all the peripheral stuff that comes with success .
ESFP	It was so draining . Going to parties to rub elbows with so-and-so and act like it 's no big deal , when really all I was doing was hoping I 'd have the success they had .
ESFJ	For a good 10 to 12 years , I was working non-stop and I was n't really enjoying my success .
ENTJ	Democrats believe in reigniting the American dream by removing barriers to success and building ladders of opportunity for all , so everyone can succeed .
ISTP	Success is always something completely different to people . I feel like I 've succeeded , if I 'm doing something that makes me happy and I 'm not lying to anybody .
ESTJ	Without an open-minded mind , you can never be a great success .
ENTJ	You 've got to eat while you dream . You 've got to deliver on short-range commitments , while you develop a long-range strategy and vision and implement it . The success of doing both . Walking and chewing gum if you will . Getting it done in the short-range , and delivering a long-range plan , and executing on that .
ESTP	I sort of understood that when I first started : that you should n't repeat a success . Very often you 're going to , and maybe the first time you do , it works . And you love it . But then you 're trapped .
ENFJ	I wish I could just go tell all the young women I work with , all these fabulous women , 'Believe in yourself and negotiate for yourself . Own your own success . ' I wish I could tell that to my daughter . But it 's not that simple .
INFP	It 's so interesting how success hits people and how they react to it .
ISTP	Success is always something completely different to people . I feel like I 've succeeded , if I 'm doing something that makes me happy and I 'm not lying to anybody . I 'm not doing that now , so I feel really good about myself .
ISTP	This weird thing happens when you 're in a movie that has some level of success . People start offering you all kinds of things , and they just expect you to do them because they 'll be good for your career . It 's not about the project 's integrity or anything like that .
ENFP	I 've learned that success comes in a very prickly package . Whether you choose to accept it or not is up to you .
ESFJ	The hardest thing to find in life is balance - especially the more success you have , the more you look to the other side of the gate . What do I need to stay grounded , in touch , in love , connected , emotionally balanced ? Look within yourself .
ESFP	I had a lot of success from the start . I never really was tested for long periods of time . I got my first professional job while I was a senior in college . I signed with the William Morris Agency before I graduated .
ENFP	The one thing that makes me feel super lucky about my financial success is that I have a housekeeper .
INFP	The quick success was a bit strange to get used to .
INTP	I have found no greater satisfaction than achieving success through honest dealing and strict adherence to the view that , for you to gain , those you deal with should gain as well .
ISTP	Anyone who has to fight , even with the most modern weapons , against an enemy in complete command of the air , fights like a savage against modern European troops , under the same handicaps and with the same chances of success .
ISTP	To me , success is choice and opportunity .
ESFJ	Well , you ca n't be trying to achieve success of any kind in this business without accepting that there 's going to be a flip side to it .
ISFP	The success of Watermark surprised me . I never thought of music as something commercial it was something very personal to me .
ESFP	You wan na know what scares people ? Success . When you do n't make moves and when you do n't climb up the ladder , everybody loves you because you 're not competition .
ENTP	The key to sitcom success is miserable people . If you see a happy couple , it 's just gone , like when Sam and Diane got together on Cheers .
INFJ	With the success of the last three or so years , when a lot of people start treating you differently , there 's a danger that you may start to think of yourself differently . You rely on your friends to say , 'Hey , wake up ! '
INFJ	I came from a family where I felt great pressure to be financially successful , and I felt that staying in Chicago and doing theater , I was , in all likelihood , not going to find financial success .
ISFP	When making music I sink myself into the process as deeply as I can and forget all of the success .
ISFP	The writing of a melody is an emotional moment success does n't make it easy .
ISFP	Fame and success are very different things .
INFP	When sorrows come , they come not single spies , but in battalions .
ENFP	If there was less sympathy in the world , there would be less trouble in the world .
ENTP	Tears are the silent language of grief .
INFP	Excessive sorrow laughs . Excessive joy weeps .
INFJ	I have sometimes been wildly , despairingly , acutely miserable , racked with sorrow , but through it all I still know quite certainly that just to be alive is a grand thing .
ISTJ	Excess of grief for the dead is madness for it is an injury to the living , and the dead know it not .
ENFJ	You do n't go around grieving all the time , but the grief is still there and always will be .
ENFJ	Pity may represent little more than the impersonal concern which prompts the mailing of a check , but true sympathy is the personal concern which demands the giving of one 's soul .
INTJ	I 'm not looking for sympathy at all .
INFJ	I 've always thought of acting as more of an exercise in empathy , which is not to be confused with sympathy . You 're trying to get inside a certain emotional reality or motivational reality and try to figure out what that 's about so you can represent it .
INTJ	Interest does not tie nations together it sometimes separates them . But sympathy and understanding does unite them .
ESFJ	I like the Rolling Stones for karaoke . 'Sympathy For The Devil ' is a great one .
INFJ	Those who know how to think need no teachers .
ENTJ	If you think your teacher is tough , wait until you get a boss . He does n't have tenure .
ESFJ	Most of us end up with no more than five or six people who remember us . Teachers have thousands of people who remember them for the rest of their lives .
ESFJ	I do not believe there is a problem in this country or the world today which could not be settled if approached through the teaching of the Sermon on the Mount .
ESTP	Please stop teaching my children that everyone gets a trophy just for participating . What is this , the Nobel Prize ? Not everybody gets a trophy .
ENTP	I never had to learn English , French and German because I was brought up as all three languages . I had a private French teacher before I even went to school . That helped a lot .
ENTJ	Technology is just a tool . In terms of getting the kids working together and motivating them , the teacher is the most important .
ISFJ	I wanted to be a teacher .
ENFJ	A little girl who finds a puzzle frustrating might ask her busy mother ( or teacher ) for help . The child gets one message if her mother expresses clear pleasure at the request and quite another if mommy responds with a curt 'Do n't bother me - I 've got important work to do . '
ESFJ	I was raised in New York City and raised in the New York City theater world . My father was a theater director and an acting teacher , and it was not uncommon for me to have long discussions about the method and what the various different processes were to finding a character and exploring character and realizing that character .
ESFJ	My job requires me to put on a little dress and run around the streets of New York in heels . But I also had the financial means to hire a yoga teacher to come to my house while my sitter watched the newborn . For 95 percent of the world , that 's not realistic .
ENTP	I used to write things for friends . There was this girl I had a crush on , and she had a teacher she did n't like at school . I had a real crush on her , so almost every day I would write her a little short story where she would kill him in a different way .
ENTP	I had a great drama teacher in high school , and that 's when I started to learn about the history of theater .
ENFJ	I 'm home schooled , and I have a teacher that goes with me on all my movies .
INTP	It has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity .
ENFP	The typewriting machine , when played with expression , is no more annoying than the piano when played by a sister or near relation .
ENFP	Technological progress has merely provided us with more efficient means for going backwards .
ENTJ	All of the books in the world contain no more information than is broadcast as video in a single large American city in a single year . Not all bits have equal value .
ESFJ	Making duplicate copies and computer printouts of things no one wanted even one of in the first place is giving America a new sense of purpose .
ENTP	It is questionable if all the mechanical inventions yet made have lightened the day 's toil of any human being .
ENFP	People are stunned to hear that one company has data files on 185 million Americans .
ISTP	I 'm sorry , it 's true . Having children really changes your view on these things . We 're born , we live for a brief instant , and we die . It 's been happening for a long time . Technology is not changing it much - if at all .
ISTP	I 've always wanted to own and control the primary technology in everything we do .
ISTP	The over-all point is that new technology will not necessarily replace old technology , but it will date it . By definition . Eventually , it will replace it . But it 's like people who had black-and-white TVs when color came out . They eventually decided whether or not the new technology was worth the investment .
INTJ	Capitalist production , therefore , develops technology , and the combining together of various processes into a social whole , only by sapping the original sources of all wealth - the soil and the labourer .
ENTJ	The advance of technology is based on making it fit in so that you do n't really even notice it , so it 's part of everyday life .
INTP	We humans are an extremely important manifestation of the replication bomb , because it is through us - through our brains , our symbolic culture and our technology - that the explosion may proceed to the next stage and reverberate through deep space .

ENTJ	I believe that we were not as effective in the second term dealing with this issue of nuclear none proliferation as we had been during the first term when we stripped Libya and Iraq and A.Q . Khan and their capacity to proliferate nuclear technology .
ESTJ	There was a time when nails were high-tech . There was a time when people had to be told how to use a telephone . Technology is just a tool . People use tools to improve their lives .
ESFP	I love the modern technology now .
ESTP	With the evolution of technology , kids really need to be computer-savvy .
ESTJ	There used to be this country called the Soviet Union it 's not there anymore . Our technology was better than theirs .
ESTJ	The human condition today is better than it 's ever been , and technology is one of the reasons for that .
INTP	I see technology as being an extension of the human body .
INTP	Technology is us . There is no separation . It 's a pure expression of human creative will . It does n't exist anywhere else in the universe . I 'm rather sure of that .
ESFJ	Indiana Jones is very much an old-world kind of hero . He does n't really have any kind of superpower or rely on any kind of technology to help him out of things .
ESFJ	You can alter movie singing so much because you go into the recording studio and , just technology for recording has gotten so good , you can hold out a note and they can combine a note from take 2 and a note from take 8 .
ISFP	I do n't want technology to take me so far that I do n't have to use my brain anymore . It 's like GPS taking over and losing your internal compass . It 's always got to be tactile , still organic .
INFJ	I had an almost fetishistic attraction to film technology .
INTJ	Silicon Valley has some of the smartest engineers and technology business people in the world .
INTP	Society will decide after the technology is created what we will and wo n't accept .
INTP	The best museums and museum exhibits about science or technology give you the feeling that , hey , this is interesting , but maybe I could do something here , too .
INFP	As a teenager I was so insecure . I was the type of guy that never fitted in because he never dared to choose . I was convinced I had absolutely no talent at all . For nothing . And that thought took away all my ambition too .
ISFP	My teenage years were exactly what they were supposed to be . Everybody has their own path . It 's laid out for you . It 's just up to you to walk it .
ESFJ	So many people try to grow up too fast , and it 's not fun ! You should stay a kid as long as possible !
ENFJ	I was a quiet teenager , introverted , full of angst .
ESTJ	I spent the first fourteen years of my life convinced that my looks were hideous . Adolescence is painful for everyone , I know , but mine was plain weird .
ESTP	At the age of 16 I was already dreaming of having a baby because I felt myself to be an adult , but my mum forbid it . Right now , I feel like a teenager and I want to have fun for one or two more years before starting a family .
ESTJ	If a movie is n't a hit right out of the gate , they drop it . Which means that the whole mainstream Hollywood product has been skewed toward violence and vulgar teen comedy .
INFP	I was n't going to have fun doing a teen movie again .
ISFP	Teen pop will never die as long as there are teens and popular music . It just takes a different head .
ENFP	Being a teen idol is what I 've waited for my whole life .

ISTP	I am thankful for laughter , except when milk comes out of my nose .
ISFP	It 's been quite a roller coaster ride , but I 've grown and learned a lot about myself . The greatest thing is being able to interact with fans and touch people 's lives ... for that I give thanks .
ISFP	I 'm very thankful to be doing what I 'm doing . I feel very blessed .
ENFJ	Look folks , we know who built this country and we know who is going to rebuild it . It 's you . Instead of vilifying you , we should be thanking you . We owe you .
ENFJ	Be thankful for what you have you 'll end up having more . If you concentrate on what you do n't have , you will never , ever have enough .
INFP	The thankful receiver bears a plentiful harvest .
ESTJ	I 'm thankful for the incredible advances in medicine that have taken place during my lifetime . I almost certainly would n't still be here if it were n't for them .
ESFJ	I want to let my fans get to know a little about me . I 'm very thankful for everything they 've done for me so , of course , I 'm going to let them into my world a bit . But I really am a very private person , and I love kepping my life to myself - that 's how I 've always been .
ENTP	Lost time is never found again .

ENFJ	We must use time creatively .
INTP	Time is what prevents everything from happening at once .
INFP	In a time of universal deceit - telling the truth is a revolutionary act .
ESTP	If you have an important point to make , do n't try to be subtle or clever . Use a pile driver . Hit the point once . Then come back and hit it again . Then hit it a third time - a tremendous whack .
ESTP	There is no better than adversity . Every defeat , every heartbreak , every loss , contains its own seed , its own lesson on how to improve your performance the next time .
INFP	Time you enjoy wasting , was not wasted .
ENFP	Some people see things that are and ask , Why ? Some people dream of things that never were and ask , Why not ? Some people have to go to work and do n't have time for all that .
ENFP	The very existence of flame-throwers proves that some time , somewhere , someone said to themselves , You know , I want to set those people over there on fire , but I 'm just not close enough to get the job done .
INTP	When I am getting ready to reason with a man , I spend one-third of my time thinking about myself and what I am going to say and two-thirds about him and what he is going to say .
INTP	At what point then is the approach of danger to be expected ? I answer , if it ever reach us , it must spring up amongst us . It can not come from abroad . If destruction be our lot , we must ourselves be its author and finisher . As a nation of freemen , we must live through all time , or die by suicide .
INTP	There is another old poet whose name I do not now remember who said , 'Truth is the daughter of Time . '
ENFP	Substitute 'damn ' every time you 're inclined to write 'very ' your editor will delete it and the writing will be just as it should be .

ISTP	If you spend too much time thinking about a thing , you 'll never get it done .
ESTP	This is no time for ease and comfort . It is time to dare and endure .
ESTP	It is a mistake to look too far ahead . Only one link of the chain of destiny can be handled at a time .

ESTP	No idea is so outlandish that it should not be considered with a searching but at the same time a steady eye .
ENTP	The time you enjoy wasting is not wasted time .
INFP	I wasted time , and now doth time waste me .
INFP	If you can look into the seeds of time , and say which grain will grow and which will not , speak then unto me .
INFP	Time and the hour run through the roughest day .
ESFP	The time to repair the roof is when the sun is shining .
ENFJ	Do the one thing you think you can not do . Fail at it . Try again . Do better the second time . The only people who never tumble are those who never mount the high wire . This is your moment . Own it .
ESFP	No matter what time it is , wake me , even if it 's in the middle of a Cabinet meeting .
ENTP	Leisure is the time for doing something useful . This leisure the diligent person will obtain the lazy one never .

ENTJ	For one swallow does not make a summer , nor does one day and so too one day , or a short time , does not make a man blessed and happy .
INTJ	Glance into the world just as though time were gone : and everything crooked will become straight to you .
ISTP	I went to a restaurant that serves 'breakfast at any time ' . So I ordered French Toast during the Renaissance .
ISTP	You ca n't just ask customers what they want and then try to give that to them . By the time you get it built , they 'll want something new .
ENTJ	Whether if soul did not exist time would exist or not , is a question that may fairly be asked for if there can not be someone to count there can not be anything that can be counted , so that evidently there can not be number for number is either what has been , or what can be , counted .
ENTJ	If you just set out to be liked , you would be prepared to compromise on anything at any time , and you would achieve nothing .
ISFP	For a long time I was scared I 'd find out I was like my mother .
ISFP	Consider the fellow . He never spends his time telling you about his previous night 's date . You get the idea he has eyes only for you and would n't think of looking at another woman .
ISFP	Anything I 've ever said , I certainly was feeling at the time .
ISFP	Well , I 'm working all the time to stay out of trouble !
ESTP	If you treat people right they will treat you right ... ninety percent of the time .
INTJ	People wo n't have time for you if you are always angry or complaining .
ENFP	I think people should be allowed to do anything they want . We have n't tried that for a while . Maybe this time it 'll work .
ESFP	Once you have mastered time , you will understand how true it is that most people overestimate what they can accomplish in a year - and underestimate what they can achieve in a decade !
ISFJ	How much time he saves who does not look to see what his neighbor says or does or thinks .
ESTJ	Most people spend more time and energy going around problems than in trying to solve them .
ESTP	Nine-tenths of wisdom is being wise in time .
INTP	As people are walking all the time , in the same spot , a path appears .
ESTP	Instead of worrying about what people say of you , why not spend time trying to accomplish something they will admire .
ESFP	Live one day at a time emphasizing ethics rather than rules .
ENTJ	Acting is a nice childish profession - pretending you 're someone else and , at the same time , selling yourself .
ISFP	We have time , there 's no big rush .
INTP	The senses deceive from time to time , and it is prudent never to trust wholly those who have deceived us even once .
ESTP	His talent was as natural as the pattern that was made by the dust on a butterfly 's wings . At one time he understood it no more than the butterfly did and he did not know when it was brushed or marred .
ENFJ	I really wanted to retire and rest and spend more time with my children , my grandchildren and of course with my wife .
ISFJ	Time is a sort of river of passing events , and strong is its current no sooner is a thing brought to sight than it is swept by and another takes its place , and this too will be swept away .
ESFP	The first time that I performed as an actor was the first day on the set of 'The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air . '
INFP	For a long time I tried to manage an honesty and openness about my personal life because I 'm human and I 'm normal - well , semi-normal .
INTJ	Only the guy who is n't rowing has time to rock the boat .
ISTJ	Civilization began the first time an angry person cast a word instead of a rock .
ENTP	We 've protected thousands of people in Libya we have not seen a single U.S. casualty there 's no risks of additional escalation . This operation is limited in time and in scope .
ISTJ	We always live in an uncertain world . What is certain is that the United States will go forward over time .
ENTP	We need to internalize this idea of excellence . Not many folks spend a lot of time trying to be excellent .
ESTJ	It has been my observation that most people get ahead during the time that others waste .
ESTP	Ezra was right half the time , and when he was wrong , he was so wrong you were never in any doubt about it .
INFP	I can only note that the past is beautiful because one never realises an emotion at the time . It expands later , and thus we do n't have complete emotions about the present , only about the past .
ENTJ	If you set out to be liked , you would be prepared to compromise on anything at any time , and you would achieve nothing .
ENTP	People of Berlin - people of the world - this is our moment . This is our time .
ENTP	We all knew this . We all knew that it would take more time than any of us want to dig ourselves out of this hole created by this economic crisis .
ENTJ	To keep your character intact you can not stoop to filthy acts . It makes it easier to stoop the next time .
ISTP	I put instant coffee in a microwave oven and almost went back in time .
ENTP	Perfection is attained by slow degrees it requires the hand of time .
ISTP	I like Mitt Romney as a person . I think he 's a dignified person . But I have no common ground on economics . He does n't worry about the Federal Reserve . He does n't worry about foreign policy . He does n't talk about civil liberties , so I would have a hard time to expect him to ever invite me to campaign with him .
ISTP	And I think it 's that time . And I think if you just step aside and Mr. Romney can kind of take over . You can maybe still use a plane . Though maybe a smaller one . Not that big gas guzzler you are going around to colleges and talking about student loans and stuff like that .
INFP	There is not enough time to do all the nothing we want to do .
ENTJ	I spend a lot of time reading .
ISTJ	You know , people talk about this being an uncertain time . You know , all time is uncertain . I mean , it was uncertain back in - in 2007 , we just did n't know it was uncertain . It was - uncertain on September 10th , 2001 . It was uncertain on October 18th , 1987 , you just did n't know it .
ISFP	Well , especially now I come to realize - and then - I would do my schooling which was three hours with a tutor and right after that I would go to the recording studio and record , and I 'd record for hours and hours until it 's time to go to sleep .
ISTJ	Time is the friend of the wonderful company , the enemy of the mediocre .
ENTJ	It pays to know the enemy - not least because at some time you may have the opportunity to turn him into a friend .
ENFP	Words , words , words ! They shut one off from the universe . Three quarters of the time one 's never in contact with things , only with the beastly words that stand for them .
ISFJ	Mr. President , you were elected to lead . You chose to follow . And now it 's time for you to get out of the way .
ISFJ	Instead of leading the world by how much we borrow , it 's time that we make sure we lead the world in how much we build and create and invest .
ISFJ	I went to Massachusetts to make a difference . I did n't go there to begin a political career running time and time again . I made a difference . I put in place the things I wanted to do .
ISFJ	It 's time for the party of big ideas , not the party of Big Brother !
ISTP	In time it will become clear to everyone that support for the policies of pre-emptive war and interventionist nation-building will have much greater significance than the removal of Saddam Hussein itself .
ISTP	Right now I 'm having amnesia and deja vu at the same time .
ENTJ	Take time to deliberate , but when the time for action has arrived , stop thinking and go in .
ISTP	Everybody thinks making films back to back is a big deal but they did it all the time in the old days .
ISTP	I keep working because I learn something new all the time .
ISFJ	At a time when nobody thought we 'd ever see a new steel mill built in America , we took a chance and built one in a corn field in Indiana . Today Steel Dynamics is one of the largest steel producers in the United States .
ISTP	I bought some instant water one time but I did n't know what to add to it .
INFP	The time for action is now . It 's never too late to do something .
INTJ	If we do discover a complete theory , it should be in time understandable in broad principle by everyone . Then we shall all , philosophers , scientists , and just ordinary people be able to take part in the discussion of why we and the universe exist .
ISTP	As recent as the year 2000 we won elections by saying we should n't be the policemen of the world , and that we should not be nation building . And its time we got those values back into this country .
ISTP	I saw a bank that said '24 Hour Banking , ' but I do n't have that much time .
ESTP	It takes a long time to bring the past up to the present .
ENTJ	It 's life is n't it ? You plow ahead and make a hit . And you plow on and someone passes you . Then someone passes them . Time levels .
ISTJ	The only time to buy these is on a day with no 'y ' in it .
ENTJ	Digital reading will completely take over . It 's lightweight and it 's fantastic for sharing . Over time it will take over .
ENTJ	Oh , I think there are a lot of people who would be buying and selling online today that go up there and they get the information , but then when it comes time to type in their credit card they think twice because they 're not sure about how that might get out and what that might mean for them .
ENTJ	I think the thing we see is that as people are using video games more , they tend to watch passive TV a bit less . And so using the PC for the Internet , playing video games , is starting to cut into the rather unbelievable amount of time people spend watching TV .
ESTP	Do your damnedest in an ostentatious manner all the time .
ESFP	I 've done everything I wanted to do , even if I have had to pay a very high price - which has been the case most of the time .
ESTP	I like to hide behind the characters I play . Despite the public perception , I am a very private person who has a hard time with the fame thing .
ISFP	I think I 'm finally growing up - and about time .
ESTJ	My two secrets to staying healthy : wash your hands all the time . And , if you ca n't , use Purell or one of the sanitizers . And the other is hot peppers . I eat a lot of hot peppers . I for some reason started doing that in 1992 , and I swear by it .
ENFP	What with making their way and enjoying what they have won , heroes have no time to think . But the sons of heroes - ah , they have all the necessary leisure .
ENTJ	No woman in my time will be prime minister or chancellor or foreign secretary - not the top jobs . Anyway , I would n't want to be prime minister you have to give yourself 100 percent .
ISFJ	I do n't even drink ! I ca n't stand the taste of alcohol . Every New Year 's Eve I try one drink and every time it makes me feel sick . So I do n't touch booze - I 'm always the designated driver .
INFP	In our time political speech and writing are largely the defense of the indefensible .
ENTJ	There comes a time when deceit and defiance must be seen for what they are . At that point , a gathering danger must be directly confronted . At that point , we must show that beyond our resolutions is actual resolve .
ESTJ	The time has come for all evangelists to practice full financial disclosure . The world is watching how we walk and how we talk . We must have the highest standards of morality , ethics and integrity if we are to continue to have influence .
ENTP	A truer image of the world , I think , is obtained by picturing things as entering into the stream of time from an eternal world outside , than from a view which regards time as the devouring tyrant of all that is .
INFP	In seed time learn , in harvest teach , in winter enjoy .
ISTP	Most of the time I do n't have much fun . The rest of the time I do n't have any fun at all .
INTJ	We should not say that one man 's hour is worth another man 's hour , but rather that one man during an hour is worth just as much as another man during an hour . Time is everything , man is nothing : he is at the most time 's carcass .
ESTJ	I 've spent too much time giving speeches , traveling the world .
ENFP	I must uphold my ideals , for perhaps the time will come when I shall be able to carry them out .
ESTJ	We know in New York we have several million at any one time who are in New York illegally .
ESTJ	I always supported the women I worked with having time off to go to parent-teacher conferences and doctors ' appointments or bringing their infants into the office .
ESTJ	I am shocked at how much time I spend in the White House . I mean , you know , for people on the outside , the idea of going to the White House for a meeting must seem like the most important , serious , even glamorous kind of thing to do .
ESTJ	Sometimes overturning brutal regimes takes time and costs lives . I wish it were n't so . I really , really do .
INFP	The intellectual is different from the ordinary man , but only in certain sections of his personality , and even then not all the time .
INTJ	My favorite time in the cycles of public life is the time when the Pope is dead and they have n't elected a new one . There 's no one in the world who is infallible for those weeks . And you know , I do n't miss it .
INFP	Eternity is in love with the productions of time .
ESFP	Life gives you plenty of time to do whatever you want to do if you stay in the present moment .
ENTP	Both in thought and in feeling , even though time be real , to realise the unimportance of time is the gate of wisdom .
INTP	For the first half of geological time our ancestors were bacteria . Most creatures still are bacteria , and each one of our trillions of cells is a colony of bacteria .
ENFP	I live in a crazy time .
ISTJ	The most thought-provoking thing in our thought-provoking time is that we are still not thinking .
ENTP	Be of service . Whether you make yourself available to a friend or co-worker , or you make time every month to do volunteer work , there is nothing that harvests more of a feeling of empowerment than being of service to someone in need .
ESFP	I sacrifice in my love life and my social life , but those things will be there in three or four years . This is a really important time in my life . I ca n't just be the girl who sang 'I Kissed a Girl . ' I have to leave a legacy .
ISFP	In every battle there comes a time when both sides consider themselves beaten , then he who continues the attack wins .
ENTP	The person who grieves suffers his passion to grow upon him he indulges it , he loves it but this never happens in the case of actual pain , which no man ever willingly endured for any considerable time .
ESTP	If you look - look at - I mean , look at what 's going on with your gasoline prices . They 're going to go to $ 5 , $ 6 , $ 7 and we do n't have anybody in Washington that calls OPEC and says , 'Fellas , it 's time . It 's over . You 're not going to do it anymore . '
ISTP	You will launch many projects , but have time to finish only a few . So think , plan , develop , launch and tap good people to be responsible . Give them authority and hold them accountable . Trying to do too much yourself creates a bottleneck .
ESFJ	All my life , whenever it comes time to make a decision , I make it and forget about it .
ISTJ	Time is not a thing , thus nothing which is , and yet it remains constant in its passing away without being something temporal like the beings in time .
ESFJ	My own time is passing fast enough without some national game to help it along .
ESTP	I suppose , in a way , this has become part of my soul . It is a symbol of my life . Whatever I have done that really matters , I 've done wearing it . When the time comes , it will be in this that I journey forth . What greater honor could come to an American , and a soldier ?
INFP	I do believe sometimes discipline is very important . I 'm not just lying around like a lazy cow all the time .
ENTJ	Do n't forget it 's daylight savings time . You spring forward , then you fall back . It 's like Robert Downey Jr. getting out of bed .
ESTP	Every time you walk down the street people are screaming , 'You 're fired ! '
ISTJ	Time goes on . So whatever you 're going to do , do it . Do it now . Do n't wait .
ENFP	And as a character , what I found very inspiring about playing Dharma , especially at that time , is that the women on television were more neurotic than they were free . And I thought , this is a rare bird and this is unique on television and I think it 's really refreshing .
ESFJ	I like ice hockey , but it 's a frustrating game to watch . It 's hard to keep your eyes on both the puck and the players and too much time passes between scoring in hockey . There are usually more fights than there are points .
ENTP	Children are smarter than any of us . Know how I know that ? I do n't know one child with a full time job and children .
INFP	I do not read advertisements . I would spend all of my time wanting things .
ESFJ	A lot of people would be embarrassed to admit that they were on 'Barney ' , but I embrace the fact . I just had such a wonderful time doing that show . I learned what a camera and prop is , and all that . I learned my manners too , so I guess that 's a good thing !
ESFJ	It 's plain hokum . If you ca n't convince 'em , confuse 'em . It 's an old political trick . But this time it wo n't work .
ENFP	What does it mean to pre-board ? Do you get on before you get on ?
ENFP	We travel , some of us forever , to seek other states , other lives , other souls .

INFP	Travelers repose and dream among my leaves .
INTJ	I love short trips to New York to me it is the finest three-day town on earth .

ENTJ	You and I come by road or rail , but economists travel on infrastructure .
ESTJ	I want to teach . I want to speak . I want to travel .
INFP	The man who never in his mind and thoughts travel 'd to heaven is no artist .
ENFP	The first time probably people really were aware of me , I unfortunately had the title of Showtime 's Funniest Person in America . And that 's a really tough title to travel around with when you 're not even known .
ISFP	I travel around the world constantly promoting my projects and endorsing products . Yes , I do get paid to go to parties in fact , I 'm the person who started the whole trend of paid appearances . But when you see me at a party , I 'm always working or promoting something .
ENFP	I want to see friends more and travel more .
ENTP	Christmas to a child is the first terrible proof that to travel hopefully is better than to arrive .
ESFJ	The secret to modern life is finding the measure in time management . I have two kids , career and I travel , and I do n't think my life is any different than most couples . The most valuable commodity now for many people is time and how to parcel that out .
ESFJ	I have two kids , career and I travel , and I do n't think my life is any different than most couples . The most valuable commodity now for many people is time and how to parcel that out .

ISFP	I do n't feel restless , I just like to travel .
ESTJ	When I have n't been working I 've tried to travel a lot .
INFJ	It 's important to travel and move and have a continual set of experiences so you 've got more to feed back into your work . For me , it 's a natural thing .
ENTP	I think it 's important that kids have responsibilities and understand the value of things , but I think it 's great I get to travel the world with my daughter .
ENTJ	I grew up in South Africa and I would look at maps and we were at the bottom of the world . There was this whole thing up there . I was always reading encyclopedias about the world . So travel was something I was always attracted to .
ENFP	I was young . I was newly married . And I had worked like a dog . I just wanted to live and travel .
ESFJ	I do n't take any photographs . I travel a lot by myself , and I feel weird taking photos on my own .
ENFP	I like to travel by myself .
ESTP	When I get logical , and I do n't trust my instincts - that 's when I get in trouble .
ESFP	Trust , but verify .
INFJ	When a man assumes a public trust he should consider himself a public property .
INFP	Me , I 'm dishonest , and you can always trust a dishonest man to be dishonest . Honestly , it 's the honest ones you have to watch out for .

INFP	The essential act of war is destruction , not necessarily of human lives , but of the products of human labor .
INFP	War is evil , but it is often the lesser evil .
ISTJ	War settles nothing .
ESTP	One can not wage war under present conditions without the support of public opinion , which is tremendously molded by the press and other forms of propaganda .
ENTP	I venture to say no war can be long carried on against the will of the people .

ISFJ	This war is not about slavery .
ESTP	In war there is no substitute for victory .
INFJ	All oppression creates a state of war .
INTJ	Dalton 's records , carefully preserved for a century , were destroyed during the World War II bombing of Manchester . It is not only the living who are killed in war .
INTJ	It is not only the living who are killed in war .
INTP	Of all the enemies of public liberty , war is perhaps the most to be dreaded , because it comprises and develops the germ of every other .
INTP	Even philosophers will praise war as ennobling mankind , forgetting the Greek who said : 'War is bad in that it begets more evil than it kills . '
ISFJ	It is good that war is so horrible , or we might grow to like it .
ISFJ	The war ... was an unnecessary condition of affairs , and might have been avoided if forebearance and wisdom had been practiced on both sides .
INTJ	Total war is no longer war waged by all members of one national community against all those of another . It is total ... because it may well involve the whole world .
INTP	The executive has no right , in any case , to decide the question , whether there is or is not cause for declaring war .
ESTP	In war , you win or lose , live or die - and the difference is just an eyelash .
INFJ	Wanton killing of innocent civilians is terrorism , not a war against terrorism .
INFP	My songs are my kids . Some of them stay with me , some others I have to send out , out to the war . It might sound stupid and it might even sound naive , but that 's just the way it is .
INFP	The connection between dress and war is not far to seek your finest clothes are those you wear as soldiers .
ENTJ	In war , events of importance are the result of trivial causes .
INFJ	Nowadays it is the fashion to emphasize the horrors of the last war . I did n't find it so horrible . There are just as horrible things happening all round us today , if only we had eyes to see them .
ESTP	This administration here and now declares unconditional war on poverty .
ESTP	I 'm tired . I 'm tired of feeling rejected by the American people . I 'm tired of waking up in the middle of the night worrying about the war .
INTP	War contains so much folly , as well as wickedness , that much is to be hoped from the progress of reason .
INFP	This is an important book , the critic assumes , because it deals with war . This is an insignificant book because it deals with the feelings of women in a drawing-room .
INTJ	I love it when Muslims go to war with each other , as I do when the Christians do , because it shows there 's no such thing as the Christian world and the Islamic world . That 's all crap .
ENTJ	It is Barack Obama who is at war with this country . Recent events prove it . This is not a cliche . It 's not a figure of speech . Obama is at war with the U.S. economy .
ENFP	All this happened , more or less . The war parts , anyway , are pretty much true .
ISTJ	The condition of man ... is a condition of war of everyone against everyone .
ESTP	The terrorists and their supporters declared war on the United States - and war is what they got .
INFP	Virtue is a state of war , and to live in it we have always to combat with ourselves .
ESTP	Some have argued that confronting the threat from Iraq could detract from the war against terror . To the contrary , confronting the threat posed by Iraq is crucial to winning the war on terror .
ESTP	This was not an act of terrorism , but it was an act of war .
ESTP	With those attacks , the terrorists and their supporters declared war on the United States . And war is what they got .
ESFP	For one thing , I do n't think that anybody in any war thinks of themselves as a hero .
INFJ	We can , for example , be fairly confident that either there will be a world without war or there wo n't be a world - at least , a world inhabited by creatures other than bacteria and beetles , with some scattering of others .
ESTP	War is a blessing compared with national degradation .
ESTP	What is more immoral than war ?
ESFP	I interviewed survivors , I went to Poland , saw the cities and spent time with the people and spoke to the Jews who had come back to Poland after the war and talked about why they had come back .
ESFP	When war comes , two things happen - profits go way , way up and all perishables go way , way down . There becomes a market for them .
ESFP	In the re-creation of combat situations , and this is coming from a director who 's never been in one , being mindful of what these veterans have actually gone through , you find that the biggest concern is that you do n't look at war as a geopolitical endeavor .
ENTP	As for charity , it is a matter in which the immediate effect on the persons directly concerned , and the ultimate consequence to the general good , are apt to be at complete war with one another .
ESFJ	Australians are coffee snobs . An influx of Italian immigrants after World War II ensured that - we probably had the word 'cappuccino ' about 20 years before America . Cafe culture is really big for Aussies . We like to work hard , but we take our leisure time seriously .
ESTP	This is not Johnson 's war . This is America 's war . If I drop dead tomorrow , this war will still be with you .
INTJ	I do n't think the war in Afghanistan was ruthlessly enough waged .
INTJ	A faction willing to take the risks of making war on the ossified status quo in the Middle East can be described as many things , but not as conservative .
INTJ	There are people who can not forget , as neither do I , the lesson of the years of the Indochina War . Which was , first , that the state is capable of being a murderer . A mass murderer , and a conspirator and a liar .
ESTP	Nullification means insurrection and war and the other states have a right to put it down .
ISTP	I want a world without war , a world without insanity . I want to see people do well . I do n't even think it 's as much as what I want for myself . It 's more what I want for the people around me . That 's what I want .
ISFJ	There 's no doubt that usually a president 's public image is enhanced by going to war . That never did appeal to me .
ISFJ	I had very good support from Democrats and Republicans all throughout my administration . I had a very high batting average . We added more jobs per year in my four years than any other president since the Second World War .
ISFP	If men make war in slavish obedience to rules , they will fail .
ENFJ	War is organized murder and torture against our brothers .
ENTJ	I was a little girl in World War II and I 'm used to being freed by Americans .
ENTJ	The U.N. bureaucracy has grown to elephantine proportions . Now that the Cold War is over , we are asking that elephant to do gymnastics .
ENTJ	I saw what happened when a dictator was allowed to take over a piece of a country and the country went down the tubes . And I saw the opposite during the war when America joined the fight .
ENTP	I had nearly finished school because I was making effort not that bad on that . But there was a law in Germany after the war . You could not make your final examination before 18 , so lots of people who were late because of the way had to do it first .
ENFJ	Mine is the first generation able to contemplate the possibility that we may live our entire lives without going to war or sending our children to war .
ENFJ	To all those who walk the path of human cooperation war must appear loathsome and inhuman .
INFP	For what can war , but endless war , still breed ?
INTP	War has become a luxury that only small nations can afford .
ESTJ	We 've finally given liberals a war against fundamentalism , and they do n't want to fight it . They would except that it would put them on the same side as the United States .
ISTJ	Force and fraud are in war the two cardinal virtues .
ESFP	I 'm a lad of the '60s . I started a magazine to try and end the Vietnam war , but it was a number of years before I had the profile , the financial resources and the time to do more .
ENFJ	In April 1991 , after the Gulf war , Iraq was given 15 days to provide a full and final declaration of all its WMD .
ISTP	I ca n't go to war with paparazzi .
ESFP	Everybody has a job to do . There are people in Iraq on both sides of this war who do what they do for religious reasons , and they feel with God on their side . Some people are good at annihilating people . Maybe that 's their gift .
ESFJ	New terms used like , 'overseas contingency operation ' instead of the word 'war ' - that reflects a worldview that is out of touch with the enemy that we face . We ca n't spin our way out of this threat .
ESFJ	Despite what the pundits want us to think , contested primaries are n't civil war , they are democracy at work , and that 's beautiful .
ESTJ	We are at war , and our security as a nation depends on winning that war .
ISFP	I have a friend that is a WWII buff , and we sat and talked a lot about stuff like the war and the reasons behind it , and you now it 's all in the uniform . Once you 're in it , it usually does all the work for you .
ISTJ	War consisteth not in battle only , or the act of fighting but in a tract of time , wherein the will to contend by battle is sufficiently known .
ENTJ	Conservatives saw the savagery of 9/11 in the attacks and prepared for war liberals saw the savagery of the 9/11 attacks and wanted to prepare indictments and offer therapy and understanding for our attackers .
ENTJ	Winston Churchill aroused this nation in heroic fashion to save civilisation in World War Two . We have everything we need except political will , but political will is a renewable resource .
ENFJ	A majority of this country opposes this war , a majority of this country never voted for this administration .
ENTJ	I have absolutely no regret about my vote against this war . The same questions remain . The cost in human lives , the cost to our budget , probably 100 billion . We could have probably brought down that statue for a lot less .
ISTP	People like to make fun of the fans who camp out but people have renaissance fairs people do Civil War re-enactments people do what they like . I 'm tired of hearing people rage on the fans . If you do n't like 'Twilight , ' do n't buy a ticket .
INTP	The Cold War was over long before it was officially declared dead .
INTP	During the Cold War , we lived in coded times when it was n't easy and there were shades of grey and ambiguity .
INTP	In every war zone that I 've been in , there has been a reality and then there has been the public perception of why the war was being fought . In every crisis , the issues have been far more complex than the public has been allowed to know .
INTP	I worked for MI6 in the Sixties , during the great witch-hunts , when the shared paranoia of the Cold War gripped the services .
ENTJ	I think the record speaks for itself . These are two individuals who have been for the war when the headlines were good and against it when their poll ratings were bad .
ENTJ	It 's very important to go back and keep in mind the distinction between handling these events as criminal acts , which was the way we did before 9/11 , and then looking at 9/11 and saying , 'This is not a criminal act , ' not when you destroy 16 acres of Manhattan , kill 3,000 Americans , blow a big hole in the Pentagon . That 's an act of war .
ENTJ	From our perspective , trying to deal with this continuing campaign of terror , if you will , the war on terror that we 're engaged in , this is a continuing enterprise . The people that were involved in some of those activities before 9/11 are still out there .
ESTJ	It 's never acceptable to target civilians . It violates the Geneva Accords , it violates the international law of war and it violates all principles of morality .
ESFP	I mean , I was born the day war broke out , but I do n't remember all the bombs though they did actually break up Liverpool , you know . I remember when I was a little older , there was big gaps in all the streets where houses used to be . We used to play over them .
ISFP	I 've always been at war with myself , for right or wrong .
ENTJ	The fact is , Bush 's war policy has failed . It 's failed ! Who better to say so than Jack Murtha ?
INFP	When I was in Pulp , I actively did more TV stuff because that was during the Great Britpop Wars , and it seemed important to prove that indie people could speak . That war does n't exist anymore .
ENFJ	We live in the time where we have fictitious election results that elects a fictitious president . We live in a time where we have a man sending us to war for fictitious reasons .
ENFP	I feel like war should occur only for the most vital and necessary reasons , and only then .
INTJ	The chain of wedlock is so heavy that it takes two to carry it - and sometimes three .
ISFP	I 'd imagine my wedding as a fairy tale ... huge , beautiful and white .
ENFP	I remember when I was in school , they would ask , 'What are you going to be when you grow up ? ' and then you 'd have to draw a picture of it . I drew a picture of myself as a bride .
ISFJ	I think that weddings have probably been crashed since the beginning of time . Cavemen crashed them . You go to meet girls . It makes sense .
ISFJ	The Wedding March has a bit of a death march in it .
ISFJ	I 've always been the type to fall in love fast and , with every boyfriend , I plan out my wedding in my head .
ISFP	We were pretty good mates until the Beatles started to split up and Yoko came into it . It was more like old army buddies splitting up on account of wedding bells .
ENFP	One tradition I have with my friends is that when one of us gets married , we have a ton of fragrance oils and pretty bottles at the bachelorette party . Everyone puts a drop or two in a bottle for the bride and makes a wish , and the bride wears our creation on her wedding day .
INFP	A man 's got two shots for jewelry : a wedding ring and a watch . The watch is a lot easier to get on and off than a wedding ring .
ISFJ	I do n't ever really feel that wearing my wedding ring is what determines me being married or not .
ISFJ	I 've never crashed a wedding . When I was a kid I , of course , used to crash parties . Crashing a wedding is difficult though because you have to have the suit , and you have to have information in case someone catches you . You have to know at least some names and something .
ISFJ	I try to remember , as I hear about friends getting engaged , that it 's not about the ring and it 's not about the wedding . It 's a grave thing , getting married . And it 's easy to get swept up in the wrong things .
ESFJ	I am usually part of any disaster at a wedding if I 'm a bridesmaid , which I 've been lucky enough to be several times .
ENTP	We all went to Kelsey 's wedding , and yeah , we go to parties . We also go to each other 's house . A group of us got together over at Kelsey 's and just read through some plays just for the fun of it . That may not be everyone 's idea of a good time , but we had a good time .
ESTJ	I always envisioned myself having a traditional and elegant wedding .
ENFJ	If you talk to a man in a language he understands , that goes to his head . If you talk to him in his language , that goes to his heart .
INFJ	Honesty is the first chapter in the book of wisdom .
INTP	Reality is merely an illusion , albeit a very persistent one .
ESFP	When written in Chinese , the word 'crisis ' is composed of two characters . One represents danger and the other represents opportunity .
ESTJ	Obstacles are those frightful things you see when you take your eyes off your goal .
ENFJ	Turn your wounds into wisdom .
ENTP	The doors of wisdom are never shut .
INTJ	Does wisdom perhaps appear on the earth as a raven which is inspired by the smell of carrion ?
ESTP	Never tell people how to do things . Tell them what to do and they will surprise you with their ingenuity .
ESTP	It has long been an axiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important .
INFP	The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom .
ENTJ	The truest wisdom is a resolute determination .
INTJ	Start wide , expand further , and never look back .
INFJ	It is unwise to be too sure of one 's own wisdom . It is healthy to be reminded that the strongest might weaken and the wisest might err .
ENTJ	Excellence , then , is a state concerned with choice , lying in a mean , relative to us , this being determined by reason and in the way in which the man of practical wisdom would determine it .
ENTJ	The virtue of justice consists in moderation , as regulated by wisdom .
INTJ	There is more wisdom in your body than in your deepest philosophy .
ENFJ	Follow your instincts . That 's where true wisdom manifests itself .
ENTP	No party has a monopoly on wisdom . No democracy works without compromise . But when Governor Romney and his allies in Congress tell us we can somehow lower our deficit by spending trillions more on new tax breaks for the wealthy - well , you do the math . I refuse to go along with that . And as long as I 'm President , I never will .
ENTP	But what is liberty without wisdom , and without virtue ? It is the greatest of all possible evils for it is folly , vice , and madness , without tuition or restraint .
ISTJ	The older I get the more wisdom I find in the ancient rule of taking first things first . A process which often reduces the most complex human problem to a manageable proportion .
ESTJ	I learned some valuable lessons about the legislative process , the importance of bipartisan cooperation and the wisdom of taking small steps to get a big job done .
ISFJ	We must expect reverses , even defeats . They are sent to teach us wisdom and prudence , to call forth greater energies , and to prevent our falling into greater disasters .
INFP	The hours of folly are measured by the clock but of wisdom , no clock can measure .
ENTJ	Enraging liberals is simply one of the more enjoyable side effects of my wisdom .
INFP	What wisdom can you find that is greater than kindness ?
INTP	Every nation whose affairs betray a want of wisdom and stability may calculate on every loss which can be sustained from the more systematic policy of its wiser neighbors .
ESFP	In my definition of consciousness , consciousness is the same thing as life . What wisdom traditions also call spirit .
ISTJ	It is not wisdom but Authority that makes a law .
ESFJ	The word philosophy sounds high-minded , but it simply means the love of wisdom . If you love something , you do n't just read about it you hug it , you mess with it , you play with it , you argue with it .
INFJ	It seems to me that , in every culture , I come across a chapter headed 'Wisdom . ' And then I know exactly what is going to follow : 'Vanity of vanities , all is vanity . '
ENTJ	The plan was criticized by some retired military officers embedded in TV studios . But with every advance by our coalition forces , the wisdom of that plan becomes more apparent .
ENFJ	Surely , God on high has not refused to give us enough wisdom to find ways to bring us an improvement in relations between the two great nations on earth .
ENFP	Mainstream media tend to just mouth the conventional wisdom , to see everything through the filter of right and left .
ISFP	I do n't know who invented high heels , but all women owe him a lot .
INTJ	Ah , women . They make the highs higher and the lows more frequent .
ESTP	I always play women I would date .
ENTJ	I never realized until lately that women were supposed to be the inferior sex .
ENTJ	I owe nothing to Women 's Lib .
INTP	Single women have a dreadful propensity for being poor . Which is one very strong argument in favor of matrimony .
ESTP	Women are naturally secretive , and they like to do their own secreting .
ENTJ	I think today women are very scared to celebrate themselves , because then they just get labeled .
ESFP	What we women need to do , instead of worrying about what we do n't have , is just love what we do have .
ENTJ	It 's incredibly unfair . You do n't see a lot of 60-year-old women with 20-year-old men onscreen .
ENTP	Women are frightening . If you get to 41 as a man , you 're quite battle-scarred .
ENFJ	The No . 1 impediment to women succeeding in the workforce is now in the home .
ENFP	Women are made to be loved , not understood .
ENFP	All women become like their mothers . That is their tragedy . No man does . That 's his .
ISFP	I do n't hate women - they just sometimes make me mad .
INTJ	Women are considered deep - why ? Because one can never discover any bottom to them . Women are not even shallow .
ENTJ	Women are nothing but machines for producing children .
INTJ	Behind all their personal vanity , women themselves always have an impersonal contempt for woman .
ISFP	I have always had a talent for irritating women since I was fourteen .
INTJ	Genteel women suppose that those things do not really exist about which it is impossible to talk in polite company .
ESTP	The man who loves other countries as much as his own stands on a level with the man who loves other women as much as he loves his own wife .
ENTP	I hate women because they always know where things are .
ENTP	Very learned women are to be found , in the same manner as female warriors but they are seldom or ever inventors .
INTJ	Women . They are a complete mystery .
INTJ	If I became a philosopher , if I have so keenly sought this fame for which I 'm still waiting , it 's all been to seduce women basically .
ENFP	If women ran the world we would n't have wars , just intense negotiations every 28 days .
ESTP	I seem to be getting a lot of things pushed my way that are strong women . It 's like people see Hackers and they send me offers to play tough women with guns , the kind who wear no bra and a little tank top . I 'd like to play strong women who are also very feminine .
ESTJ	If a country does n't recognize minority rights and human rights , including women 's rights , you will not have the kind of stability and prosperity that is possible .
ESTJ	Women are the largest untapped reservoir of talent in the world .
INFJ	No one is more arrogant toward women , more aggressive or scornful , than the man who is anxious about his virility .
ESTJ	Human rights are women 's rights , and women 's rights are human rights .
ESTJ	I fought all my life for women to make their own choices , in their personal and professional lives . I made mine .
ESTJ	Wealthy women have rights in every country . And poor women do n't .
ESTJ	A psychologist once told me that for a boy being in the middle of a conflict between two women is the worst possible situation . There 's always a desire to please each one .
ESTP	All of the women on The Apprentice flirted with me - consciously or unconsciously . That 's to be expected .
ENTP	What Democratic congressmen do to their women staffers , Republican congressmen do to the country .
INTJ	Women are the engine driving the growth in California 's economy . Women make California 's economy unique .
INTP	Good-humoured , unaffected girls , will not do for a man who has been used to sensible women . They are two distinct orders of being .
ENTJ	Feminism was established to allow unattractive women easier access to the mainstream .
INTP	There are certainly not so many men of large fortune in the world , as there are pretty women to deserve them .
ESTP	The men and women of Afghanistan are building a nation that is free , and proud , and fighting terror - and America is honored to be their friend .
ESFJ	Black women have always been these vixens , these animalistic erotic women . Why ca n't we just be the sexy American girl next door ?
ENTP	And I highly recommend for all the women in the world , even if they 're 71 , you can never take for granted that he loves you . It 's always good to flirt with him . It 's a great sport .
ENFP	I 've been trying to find women writers for my staff for a while now and I have three women on my staff and three guys so it 's pretty equal . I do n't know why that is . It 's been the same thing for a while . It 's hard for female comedians to stand out . That 's weird . That 's a shame .
ENFP	Comedy can be , especially in a writer 's room , really aggressive , kind of a very male-dominated room , and it would be hard for women . It 's not a nurturing place . It 's not like a lot of women are going to say , I ca n't wait to live that lifestyle and be in a writer 's room until 2 or 3 a.m .
ISFJ	I remember when the wave of Jennifer Lopez , Salma Hayek and these beautiful Hispanic women came into light , and I looked up to them and I loved them , but I was like , 'Where are Middle Eastern women ? '
ESTP	America is a friend to the people of Iraq . Our demands are directed only at the regime that enslaves them and threatens us . When these demands are met , the first and greatest benefit will come to Iraqi men , women and children .
ESFJ	Black women do n't have the same body image problems as white women . They are proud of their bodies .
ENFP	There 's very little advice in men 's magazines , because men do n't think there 's a lot they do n't know . Women do . Women want to learn . Men think , 'I know what I 'm doing , just show me somebody naked . '
ENTP	Women priests . Great , great . Now there 's priests of both sexes I do n't listen to .
ESTJ	When I get up and work out , I 'm working out just as much for my girls as I am for me , because I want them to see a mother who loves them dearly , who invests in them , but who also invests in herself . It 's just as much about letting them know as young women that it is okay to put yourself a little higher on your priority list .
INFJ	Make women rational creatures , and free citizens , and they will quickly become good wives - that is , if men do not neglect the duties of husbands and fathers .
INFJ	The most mediocre of males feels himself a demigod as compared with women .
ESTP	I want to make a policy statement . I am unabashedly in favor of women .
INTJ	I 'm not particularly a feminist , but if you get women off the animal cycle of reproduction and give them some say in how many children they 'll have , immediately the floor will rise .
INFP	Reading , solitude , idleness , a soft and sedentary life , intercourse with women and young people , these are perilous paths for a young man , and these lead him constantly into danger .
ENFP	Women should stop going for the bad guys , stop looking so far when the good ones are right there .
ISTP	Imagine , a September 11 with weapons of mass destruction . It 's not 3,000 . It 's tens of thousands of innocent men , women and children .
ENFJ	For any of us in this room today , let 's start out by admitting we 're lucky . We do n't live in the world our mothers lived in , our grandmothers lived in , where career choices for women were so limited .
ENFP	Men want to make women happy .
ENTJ	I 've never wanted to look like models on the cover of magazines . I represent the majority of women and I 'm very proud of that .
INTJ	For most of my life I let women do the driving and was happy to let them .
INTJ	To terrify children with the image of hell ... to consider women an inferior creation . Is that good for the world ?
ISFP	I do n't think that women need to smell interesting .
ENFP	I like my wine like my women - ready to pass out .
ENFP	I think there are opportunities for women in comedies - how zany is up to them .
ENFP	I support women , men , anybody who is in a place that 's not their strongest and who is ready to push forward .
ENFP	I do n't know why women feel an affinity with me .
ISFP	Growing up with the childhood that I had , I learned to never let a man make me feel helpless , and it also embedded a deep need in me to always stick up for women .
ENTJ	I think women are really good at making friends and not good at networking . Men are good at networking and not necessarily making friends . That 's a gross generalization , but I think it holds in many ways .
ENTJ	I have said this many times , that there seems to be enough room in the world for mediocre men , but not for mediocre women , and we really have to work very , very hard .
ESTP	To be outspoken , or different at all , is a problem for women .
ISFP	People love talking about when they were young and heard Honky Tonk Women for the first time . It 's quite a heavy load to carry on your shoulders , the memories of so many people .
INFP	I do n't mind a dirty girl . But what I find tragic is when we , as women , become not the subject of our own story but someone else 's object .
ENTJ	Women have to be active listeners and interrupters - but when you interrupt , you have to know what you are talking about .
ISFJ	My decision to register women confirms what is already obvious throughout our society-that women are now providing all types of skills in every profession . The military should be no exception .
ESTJ	If we took away women 's right to vote , we 'd never have to worry about another Democrat president .
ENTP	I noticed in the past , a lot of guys who like strong women , they really freak out if you 're not strong 24/7 . Or they complain about you being strong , then the moment you 're not strong , they 're like , 'Oh , no , no , no . '
ISFP	I think all of us as women have this super-human quality . We create life , we give life , we are the sources of life for our children - we 're all pretty bionic .
ISFP	I definitely love women . They are more attractive to the naked eye .
ESFJ	My favorite play in drama school was 'The Bacchae . ' It 's about a king who literally gets eaten alive by all the women in the play in a kind of orgy - it 's related to the word 'bacchanal ' - and I loved that idea of animalistic chaos and following our own desires .
INFP	The violence betwen women is unbelievable . Women try to make each other crawl so that their knees are bleeding .
INFP	My father has a pragmatic mind . He marched with Dr. King in the '60s , and he 's very much for women 's rights .
INFP	There is a phenomenal amount of pressure on women in this industry : they are considered vintage by the time they hit their mid-30s .
INFP	There are older men with younger women but you do n't see a lot of older women with younger men . There are some women who have been able to do it but not often .
INFJ	Women stand for the objective world for a man . They stand for the thing that you 're not and that 's what you always reach for in a song .
ENTJ	This is pure speculation , but for a period of time , a lot of getting into a party was through fundraising and volunteer work , and Republican women had more time to do that than democratic women , who were out there getting jobs .
ENTJ	Women ca n't do everything at the same time , we need to understand milestones in our lives comes in segments .
ISTJ	The fact that the church is convinced of not having the right to confer priestly ordination on women is now considered by some as irreconcilable with the European Constitution .
INFJ	And most people have a woman in their heart , most men have a woman in their heart and most women have a man in their heart .
ISTJ	I like women . I do n't understand them , but I like them .
ENTP	Some men have a silly theory about beautiful women - that somewhere along the line they 'll turn into a monster . That movie gave them a chance to watch it happen .
ENTJ	I did go to Wellesley , a women 's college . And I am of a kind of strange generation which is transitional in terms of women who wanted to go out and get jobs .
ENTJ	I did n't want to set up a women 's studies program . I thought women should learn to operate in a coeducational atmosphere , because , especially in national security and international affairs , it 's male-dominated .
ENTJ	I think the personal relationships I established mattered in terms of what I was able to get done . And I did bring women 's issues to the center of our foreign policy .
ENTJ	I think women want to take care of themselves , and I think having a voice in how that is done is very important .
ENTP	No one wants to see curvy women .

ENTP	Work as if you were to live a hundred years . Pray as if you were to die tomorrow .

ISFP	At 35 , I 'm definitely starting to feel more like a grown-up than I ever have . There 's nothing in my life that is childish or whimsical .

ISFP	It will work . I am a marketing genius .
ENTJ	The people that make this country work , the people who pay on their mortgages , the people getting up and going to work , striving in this recession to not participate in it , they 're not the enemy . They 're the people that hire you . They 're the people that are going to give you a job .

ISFP	I suppose for me as an artist it was n't always just about expressing my work I really wanted , more than anything else , to contribute in some way to the culture that I was living in .
