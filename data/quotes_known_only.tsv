Perfection of means and confusion of ends seem to characterize our age.	Albert Einstein	age

Sometimes I think it would be easier to avoid old age, to die young, but then you'd never complete your life, would you? You'd never wholly know you.	Marilyn Monroe	age
I don't think of myself as a poor deprived ghetto girl who made good. I think of myself as somebody who from an early age knew I was responsible for myself, and I had to make good.	Oprah Winfrey	age
The kids are old enough now - I just want to let them be kids. I don't want to comment on them too much. They're at an age where I just want to let them be kids.	Eminem	age

Books were my pass to personal freedom. I learned to read at age three, and soon discovered there was a whole world to conquer that went beyond our farm in Mississippi.	Oprah Winfrey	age

How young can you die of old age?	Steven Wright	age
If youth knew if age could.	Sigmund Freud	age
I think the biggest disease the world suffers from in this day and age is the disease of people feeling unloved. I know that I can give love for a minute, for half an hour, for a day, for a month, but I can give. I am very happy to do that, I want to do that.	Princess Diana	age
The charm of history and its enigmatic lesson consist in the fact that, from age to age, nothing changes and yet everything is completely different.	Aldous Huxley	age
I created Punk for this day and age. Do you see Britney walking around wearing ties and singing punk? Hell no. That's what I do. I'm like a Sid Vicious for a new generation.	Avril Lavigne	age
We are all geniuses up to the age of ten.	Aldous Huxley	age
Every age has its own poetry in every age the circumstances of history choose a nation, a race, a class to take up the torch by creating situations that can be expressed or transcended only through poetry.	Jean-Paul Sartre	age

The biggest disease this day and age is that of people feeling unloved.	Princess Diana	age
Few women, I fear, have had such reason as I have to think the long sad years of youth were worth living for the sake of middle age.	Dwight D. Eisenhower	age
And in my own life, in my own small way, I've tried to give back to this country that has given me so much. That's why I left a job at a law firm for a career in public service, working to empower young people to volunteer in their communities. Because I believe that each of us - no matter what our age or background or walk of life - each of us has something to contribute to the life of this nation.	Michelle Obama	age
I cried on my 18th birthday. I thought 17 was such a nice age. You're young enough to get away with things, but you're old enough, too.	Liv Tyler	age

And I'm afraid, in this day and age, trust, which I count so, you know, I love loyalty. I love trust.	Elton John	age
What turns me on about the digital age, what excited me personally, is that you have closed the gap between dreaming and doing. You see, it used to be that if you wanted to make a record of a song, you needed a studio and a producer. Now, you need a laptop.	Bono	age
I wanted to be a teacher. I love children, so I wanted to deal with children. Then I wanted to be a veterinarian. But by the age of ten or eleven, when I opened my mouth and said, 'Oh, God, what's this?' I kind of knew teaching and being a veterinarian were gonna have to wait.	Whitney Houston	age
It seems as if an age of genius must be succeeded by an age of endeavour riot and extravagance by cleanliness and hard work.	Virginia Woolf	age
I believe we should encourage children to sing and play instruments from an early age.	Mick Jagger	age
I'm at peace with myself and where I am. In the past, I was always looking to see how everybody else was doing. I wasn't competitive, I was comparative. I just wanted to be where everybody else was. Now I've gotten to an age when I am not comparing anymore.	Courteney Cox	age
We have entered an age in which education is not just a luxury permitting some men an advantage over others. It has become a necessity without which a person is defenseless in this complex, industrialized society. We have truly entered the century of the educated man.	Lyndon B. Johnson	age
It is old age, rather than death, that is to be contrasted with life. Old age is life's parody, whereas death transforms life into a destiny: in a way it preserves it by giving it the absolute dimension. Death does away with time.	Simone de Beauvoir	age
It's not catastrophes, murders, deaths, diseases, that age and kill us it's the way people look and laugh, and run up the steps of omnibuses.	Virginia Woolf	age
It's really amazing that in the age of unbelief, as a smart man called it, there isn't even more fraud. After all, with no God, there's no one to ever call you to account, and no accounting at all if you can get away with it.	Ben Stein	age
In fact, my courage and my bravery at a young age was the thing I was bullied for, a kind of 'Who do you think you are?'	Lady Gaga	age
People until I was 60 would always say they thought I looked younger, which I think, without flattering myself, I did, but I think I certainly have, as George Orwell says people do after a certain age, the face they deserve.	Christopher Hitchens	age
O love, if I regret the age when one savors you, it is not for the hour of pleasure, but for the one that follows it.	Jean-Jacques Rousseau	age
I'm well past the age where I'm acceptable. You get to a certain age and you are forbidden access. You're not going to get the kind of coverage that you would like in music magazines, you're not going to get played on radio and you're not going to get played on television. I have to survive on word of mouth.	David Bowie	age
Well, I'm in my 60s now. I finally look it, I think. People until I was 60 would always say they thought I looked younger, which I think, without flattering myself, I did, but I think I certainly have, as George Orwell says people do after a certain age, the face they deserve.	Christopher Hitchens	age
'Bombing Afghanistan back into the Stone Age' was quite a favourite headline for some wobbly liberals. The slogan does all the work. But an instant's thought shows that Afghanistan is being, if anything, bombed out of the Stone Age.	Christopher Hitchens	age
Of course, the ideal scenario for parenting is obviously two parents of a mature age.	Jennifer Aniston	age
You know what makes me feel old? When I see girls who are 20-something, or the new crop of actresses, and think, Aren't we kind of the same age?	Jennifer Aniston	age
I'll tell you, there is nothing better in life than being a late bloomer. I believe that success can happen at any time and at any age.	Salma Hayek	age
You get to a certain age where you prepare yourself for happiness. Sometimes you never remember to actually get happy.	John Mayer	age
If you age with somebody, you go through so many roles - you're lovers, friends, enemies, colleagues, strangers you're brother and sister. That's what intimacy is, if you're with your soulmate.	Cate Blanchett	age
With age, you see people fail more. You see yourself fail more. How do you keep that fearlessness of a kid? You keep going. Luckily, I'm not afraid to make a fool of myself.	Hugh Jackman	age
I'm not as far along as Jack Nicklaus was at this age, but I'm trying.	Tiger Woods	age
You'd think that in this age, especially in the 21st century - especially with all the technology and all the discoveries that we've made - that we would figure out how to tackle abuse.	Tori Amos	age
I never - you know also one of the things that would save me for a man my age, it was not that easy to lose that much weight and fall down and look like something draped.	Karl Lagerfeld	age
My justification is that most people my age spend a lot of time thinking about what they're going to do for the next five or ten years. The time they spend thinking about their life, I just spend drinking.	Amy Winehouse	age
At a certain age it just became apparent to me that this was probably the work that I would have to do.	Daniel Day-Lewis	age
Why should 20-year-olds only be considered sexy? I think we get better with age.	Jenny McCarthy	age
To be free in an age like ours, one must be in a position of authority. That in itself would be enough to make me ambitious.	Hannah Arendt	age
I remember at the age of five travelling on a trolley car with my mother past a group of women on a picket line at a textile plant, seeing them being viciously beaten by security people. So that kind of thing stayed with me.	Noam Chomsky	age
I'm asked all the time in interviews about who I am, and I know a few people my age who have a strong sense of self, but I couldn't say I know myself and sum it up and give it to you in a little package. I don't know myself at all yet.	Kristen Stewart	age
Every time I see something terrible, it's like I see it at age 19. I keep a freshness that way.	Ralph Nader	age
Does age matter? Time doesn't matter.	Sandra Bullock	age
Age is the first limitation on roles that I've ever had to encounter, and I hit that awhile ago.	Jack Nicholson	age
I can't hit on women in public any more. I didn't decide this it just doesn't feel right at my age.	Jack Nicholson	age
I knew at an early age I wanted to act. Acting was always easy for me. I don't believe in predestination, but I do believe that once you get where ever it is you are going, that is where you were going to be.	Morgan Freeman	age
Even from a very early age, I knew I didn't want to miss out on anything life had to offer just because it might be considered dangerous.	Nicole Kidman	age
I was a mixture of being incredibly old for my age and incredibly backwards. I was born quite old, but then I stopped growing. I lived with my mum and dad till I was 30.	Helena Bonham Carter	age
Craziest thing I've done for love is getting married. I think it's crazy. I think it's crazy, crazy, crazy. I'm never going to say I wouldn't do it again but I have to make sure it's love and not settling for the 'I have to do this by a certain age,' which is kind of what I did.	Jenny McCarthy	age
You never choose the way that you're raised, it's just the way that you were raised, but you do get to a certain age where you're in a position to question the expectations of you and the way that you've been formed by your surroundings.	Mia Wasikowska	age
No, no, I was only funny on stage, really. I, I, think I was funny as a person toward my classmates when I was very young. You know, when I was a child, up to about the age of 12.	Rowan Atkinson	age
I never had little brothers, so I was totally not used to hearing a lot of cussing at a young age! I learned what 'pull my finger' meant the hard way.	Danica McKellar	age
I wrote a screenplay for a 'Sweet Valley High' adaptation, and it's really amazing to me how many women who are my age have responded to the idea and are excited about the movie.	Diablo Cody	age
My best friend just had a baby, and she's my age. So I'm a godmom now, which is crazy.	Kristen Stewart	age
I think I'm a bit less inhibited, and not thinking too much before speaking. It's not about being shameful, I'm just a bit more unabashedly myself because of this thing, and it probably started at age 15. I can be around people and say what I think without fear.	Kristen Stewart	age
The divine right of husbands, like the divine right of kings, may, it is hoped, in this enlightened age, be contested without danger.	Mary Wollstonecraft	age
In every age there has been a stream of popular opinion that has carried all before it, and given a family character, as it were, to the century.	Mary Wollstonecraft	age
Look, demanding somebody do anything in this day and age is not going to fly.	John Mayer	age
I was very successful from a very early age, and I want to keep it.	John Mayer	age
I don't believe in happy endings, but I do believe in happy travels, because ultimately, you die at a very young age, or you live long enough to watch your friends die. It's a mean thing, life.	George Clooney	age
You can have a spiritual awakening and discover a new side of you at any age. And best of all, love can happen at any age. Life can just start to get exciting when you're in your 40s and 50s. You have to believe that.	Salma Hayek	age
America doesn't reward people of my age, either in day-to-day life or for their performances.	Meryl Streep	age
People tend to become more emotionally intelligent as they age and mature.	Daniel Goleman	age
With age, you get to a place where you don't want to knock people out. You just want to give people a hug.	Vin Diesel	age
Situational unawareness in the private marketplace or on the battlefield will cost you your livelihood or your life. In the Age of Obama, however, such willful ignorance is a job prerequisite. The less you know the better.	Michelle Malkin	age
I want to be part of the resurgence of things that are tangible, beautiful and soulful, rather than just give in to the digital age. But when I talk to people about this they just say, 'Yeah, I know what you mean,' and stare at their mobiles.	Jack White	age
The idea of regretting not doing this seemed insane to me. Sitting in the corner at a bar at age 60, saying: 'I could've been Bond. Buy me a drink.' That's the saddest place I could be. At least now at 60 I can say: 'I was Bond. Now buy me a drink.'	Daniel Craig	age
It's not the normal way to look at things but I experienced death at a really young age and because of that it's been part of my mental landscape that death is really very possible.	Cate Blanchett	age
I've an enormous respect for my mother who at the age of 39 raised three children, and I grew up with my grandmother in the household. And so it was a really strong household of women - my poor brother! It was great growing up with so many generations of women.	Cate Blanchett	age
It lies in human nature that where you experience your first laughs, you also remember the age kindly.	Vaclav Havel	age
Michelle Pfeiffer hasn't been finding a lot of work recently because she doesn't like what a woman her age is offered. That's a real double standard. You get Sean Connery, who gets older and older, still playing opposite young ladies, but it doesn't work the other way around.	Denzel Washington	age
Even one voice can be heard loudly all over the world in this day and age.	Aung San Suu Kyi	age
At this age, I should be leading a quiet life.	Aung San Suu Kyi	age
No, but way before that, I've been doing little dances in movies for years. Yeah, that was an amazing chance. You know, at my age to be able to do a music dance video, very unusual.	Christopher Walken	age
There probably aren't a lot of actors my age who tap dance.	Christopher Walken	age
I started auditioning when I was about 10 and I didn't get my first job until I was 12, and two years at that age is really hard.	Anna Kendrick	age
I think women get caught up too much in having a plan - 'I'm going to get married at this age I'm going to have a kid at this age' - and then they just try to find a guy who will fit into that picture. I don't want my life to be based on that.	Julia Stiles	age
I think you can't really escape any kind of spiritual education as a child, whether it's New Age or Judaism or Buddhism or whatever it is. You can't escape it, even if you completely disagree with it, you still have it as a foundation that you base things off of.	Jack White	age
We live in an age, in an era where there is so much negativity, there is so much violence in the world, there is so much unrest and people are at war, that I wanted to promote the word love and red signifies love.	Elton John	age
At a young age, I was interested in comic books, which was really how I learnt to read. The name Cage came from a comic book character called Power Man.	Nicolas Cage	age
I can't wait to be that age and hanging out with a bunch of people hanging out all day playing golf and going to the beach, all my own age. We'd be laughing and having a good time and getting loopy on our prescription drugs. Driving golf carts around. I can't wait.	Cameron Diaz	age
I would love a family. I'm at the age where the wish for a child gets stronger. But who knows.	Cameron Diaz	age
I love physical kinds of comedy and getting down and dirty and doing stunts. When I was growing up, I was always getting into fights with guys and usually punching out boys my age because I was a lot bigger and tougher. So I'm naturally accustomed to putting myself into the headspace of a girl who can take care of herself.	Cameron Diaz	age
Maybe it is something to do with age, but I have become fonder of poetry than of prose.	Aung San Suu Kyi	age
I grew up on the golden age of children's TV.	Edward Norton	age
You need some insecurity if you're an actor. It keeps the pot boiling. I haven't yet started to think about retiring. I was shocked when I heard about Paul Newman retiring at age 82. Most actors just fade away like old soldiers.	Al Pacino	age
The age thing really bugs me. Do people have more of a right to not like what I say because I'm 19?	Fiona Apple	age
By the age of 9 or 10, I knew that I had to cut my own cloth and make my own way.	John le Carre	age
When you're my age and you see a story, you better go for it pretty quickly. I'd just like to get a few more novels under my belt.	John le Carre	age
I don't know whether it's age or maturity, but I certainly find myself committed more and more to the looser forms of Western democracy at any price.	John le Carre	age
I try to write lyrics so that they won't age, which sort of leaves you with the big subjects like death and love and sex and violence.	Florence Welch	age
In the modern media age we are rarely surprised by what we see. Whether it's on television or film or in the theatre, everything is so advertised, so trailed, that most entertainment is merely what you thought it was going to be like.	Rowan Atkinson	age
Maybe I'll be a feminist in my old age.	Bjork	age
I feel the 21st century is another new age. Not only can we collaborate again with nature, but we have to. It's an emergency.	Bjork	age
I'd date someone younger or older age doesn't matter to me. Or looks, really - it's all about maturity.	Leona Lewis	age
I wanted to be a forest ranger or a coal man. At a very early age, I knew I didn't want to do what my dad did, which was work in an office.	Harrison Ford	age
Parenting is an impossible job at any age.	Harrison Ford	age
You get to a certain age and you just want to prove that you can still rock - that you've still got it.	Jarvis Cocker	age
I always thought that I might retire from any form of sexuality by the age of 40 and just become a dignified older person.	Jarvis Cocker	age
Well, once you've resigned yourself to the fact that you are the more mature pop performer and you're past the age you ever thought you would do it, you might as well do it as long as you can. As long as I can still lift a microphone, then I'll do it, you know.	Jarvis Cocker	age
I think it's hard, the fact that there's a certain age that we can't have kids anymore.	Courteney Cox	age
My mother was 45 when she had me, so when I was in high school my parents were the same age as my friends' grandparents.	Jack White	age
Despite what anti-aging ads say, growing older can be better. I feel better in my skin, 100 percent. You have greater effects of gravity, but the better sense of yourself you have is something I wouldn't trade. Women who lie about their age - 'why?'	Demi Moore	age
For the moment I prefer to be a beautiful woman of my age than try desperately to look 30.	Demi Moore	age
To write a story about New York that only deals with people in your age and socioeconomic bracket, that feels dishonest to me. So much of New York comes from everyone bumping into each other.	Josh Radnor	age
I've always been intrigued by color and by interesting hair. I was one of those weird little girls doing my own hair at the age of 9. I was, like, getting weird gels and new brushes and cornrow holders. I would tweak and perm at the age of 13.	Nicki Minaj	age
My parents got married late and they had kids late, so I never felt a social or cultural thing to be married or pregnant or a homeowner by a certain age.	Anna Kendrick	age
I'm a pretty big dork. It's crazy. I'm one of those people who grew up with all kinds of musicals, but I was right at that age where 'Rent' was a big deal for me and for my friends.	Anna Kendrick	age
My parents were really, really cool about supporting what I wanted to do at a really young age. I think I was about 10 when I caught the bug. They would drive me down to New York if there were auditions. When I was 12, I did this show on Broadway called 'High Society,' so we moved to New York for the run of that.	Anna Kendrick	age
Well, my son really loves wildlife. And everytime he draws a polar bear I want to tell him there probably won't any by the time... he's my age. That's kinda hard to deal with.	Thom Yorke	age
Traveling to Russia and Germany and being able to see the world at a young age was really cool for me, and I really liked that.	Mia Wasikowska	age
I think the most exciting thing is that you expect people our age to know the music, but actually a lot of kids know the music, and if anything is left, we have left really good music, and that's the important part, not the mop-tops or whatever.	Ringo Starr	age
It is strange to be known so universally and yet to be so lonely.	Albert Einstein	alone
It's often just enough to be with someone. I don't need to touch them. Not even talk. A feeling passes between you both. You're not alone.	Marilyn Monroe	alone
Associate with men of good quality if you esteem your own reputation for it is better to be alone than in bad company.	George Washington	alone
I restore myself when I'm alone.	Marilyn Monroe	alone
I have to be alone very often. I'd be quite happy if I spent from Saturday night until Monday morning alone in my apartment. That's how I refuel.	Audrey Hepburn	alone
I don't want to be alone, I want to be left alone.	Audrey Hepburn	alone
You cannot be lonely if you like the person you're alone with.	Wayne Dyer	alone
If it's true that our species is alone in the universe, then I'd have to say the universe aimed rather low and settled for very little.	George Carlin	alone
Every man must do two things alone he must do his own believing and his own dying.	Martin Luther	alone
Loneliness is my least favorite thing about life. The thing that I'm most worried about is just being alone without anybody to care for or someone who will care for me.	Anne Hathaway	alone
I finally faced the fact that it isn't a crime not having friends. Being alone means you have fewer problems.	Whitney Houston	alone
The only real progress lies in learning to be wrong all alone.	Albert Camus	alone
If you are lonely when you're alone, you are in bad company.	Jean-Paul Sartre	alone
We are rarely proud when we are alone.	Voltaire	alone
It's an interesting combination: Having a great fear of being alone, and having a desperate need for solitude and the solitary experience. That's always been a tug of war for me.	Jodie Foster	alone
Still and all, why bother? Here's my answer. Many people need desperately to receive this message: I feel and think much as you do, care about many of the things you care about, although most people do not care about them. You are not alone.	Kurt Vonnegut	alone
There's a tremendous difference between alone and lonely. You could be lonely in a group of people. I like being alone. I like eating by myself. I go home at night and just watch a movie or hang out with my dog. I have to exert myself and really say, oh God, I've got to see my friends 'cause I'm too content being by myself.	Drew Barrymore	alone
The best part about being alone is that you really don't have to answer to anybody. You do what you want.	Justin Timberlake	alone
I have so many different personalities in me and I still feel lonely.	Tori Amos	alone

If it's an amazing role, I'll do anything.	Vin Diesel	amazing

Obama and his attack dogs have nothing but hate and anger in their hearts and spew it whenever possible.	Donald Trump	anger

A lot of my humor does come from anger. It's like, you're not gonna pull one over on me - which is pretty much my motto anyways.	Courteney Cox	anger

Your anger is a gift.	Zack de la Rocha	anger
And I think there's something about conservatives frankly - and the Left, when it comes to their channels of persuasion, are unpersuasive. They are, most of them are hate-filled, obscenity-clogged rants of anger and hatred.	Karl Rove	anger

Marriage is the most natural state of man, and... the state in which you will find solid happiness.	Benjamin Franklin	anniversary
Experts on romance say for a happy marriage there has to be more than a passionate love. For a lasting union, they insist, there must be a genuine liking for each other. Which, in my book, is a good definition for friendship.	Marilyn Monroe	anniversary
Mom and Dad were married 64 years. And if you wondered what their secret was, you could have asked the local florist - because every day Dad gave Mom a rose, which he put on her bedside table. That's how she found out what happened on the day my father died - she went looking for him because that morning, there was no rose.	Mitt Romney	anniversary
So while an incredible amount of progress has been made, on this fifth anniversary, I wanted to come here and tell the people of this city directly: My administration is going to stand with you - and fight alongside you - until the job is done.

For art to exist, for any sort of aesthetic activity to exist, a certain physiological precondition is indispensable: intoxication.	Friedrich Nietzsche	art

The art of war is simple enough. Find out where your enemy is. Get at him as soon as you can. Strike him as hard as you can, and keep moving on.	Ulysses S. Grant	art

What I've discovered is that in art, as in music, there's a lot of truth-and then there's a lie.

It's the moment that the audience falls in love.	Lady Gaga	art
Land really is the best art.	Andy Warhol	art
Growing up going to Christian school and the concept that you're born a sinner and you don't really have a choice to change who you are has been hammered into my head and created the entire reason why I made art and made a band and made records called 'Antichrist Superstar.'	Marilyn Manson	art
People who don't like me talk about it as though I'm trash because I have tattoos. I find that insane because it's 2008, not the 1950s. Tattoos aren't limited to sailors. It's a form of art I find beautiful. I love it.	Megan Fox	art
Art is an attempt to integrate evil.	Simone de Beauvoir	art
Like music and art, love of nature is a common language that can transcend political or social boundaries.	Jimmy Carter	art

Art is so subjective, and people can react however they want.	Jennifer Aniston	art
I was doing these performance art pop music pieces in the city. And they were a bit on the eccentric side I suppose. So people started to call me Gaga after the Queen song 'Radio Gaga.'	Lady Gaga	art

Becoming emancipated at 14, my life wasn't normal. I didn't have to go to school, so I didn't. I was rebellious by nature. I spent my 20s focusing on my company, Flower Films, and producing movies. Now that I'm almost 30, I would like to try other things in lie. I'm crazy about photography, and I want to take an art history class.	Drew Barrymore	art
I love doing normal things - movies, shopping, going out with friends, writing, reading, taking hot bubble baths - that's a big one for relaxation. I also love to go to art and history museums.	Christina Aguilera	art
I like science and I love gym. Oh, and I like art, but I'm really bad at it. I'm just a terrible drawer. I can't draw a circle. Even with a ruler, I can't draw a straight line.	Daniel Radcliffe	art
I don't watch television, I think it destroys the art of talking about oneself.	Stephen Fry	art

I've got tonnes of aboriginal and Native American art, but I'd like even more.	Tori Amos	art
The art world can be very intimidating because it's just so vast. You talk to people who are really clued in to all the young artists and coming into it you're never going to be able to catch up immediately, even though there's pressure to.	Daniel Radcliffe	art
Smiles come naturally to me, but I started thinking of them as an art form at my command. I studied all the time. I looked at magazines, I'd practice in front of the mirror and I'd ask photographers about the best angles. I can now pull out a smile at will.	Tyra Banks	art
Translation is the art of failure.	Umberto Eco	art

I have a small house so I borrow everything except art, that's what I love.	Salma Hayek	art
I'm not dead and I don't have blue hair but some people say there are similarities. It is usually intolerable to watch myself onscreen but this time it's fine. I think it's beautiful and a real work of art.	Helena Bonham Carter	art
I think no artist can claim to have any access to the truth, or an authentic version of an event. But obviously they have slightly better means at their disposal because they have their art to energize whatever it is they're trying to write about. They have music.	Thom Yorke	art
It is a myth that art has to be sold. It is not like stocking a grocery store where people fill a pushcart. Art is a product that has no apparent need. The salesperson builds the need in the mind of the buyer.	Jack White	art
I just like art. I get pure pleasure from it. I have a lot of wonderful paintings, and every time I look at them I see something different.	Jack Nicholson	art

When I was a child I asked my mother what homosexuality was about and she said - and this was 100 years ago in Germany and she was very open-minded - 'It's like hair color. It's nothing. Some people are blond and some people have dark hair. It's not a subject.' This was a very healthy attitude.	Karl Lagerfeld	attitude
My attitude to peace is rather based on the Burmese definition of peace - it really means removing all the negative factors that destroy peace in this world. So peace does not mean just putting an end to violence or to war, but to all other factors that threaten peace, such as discrimination, such as inequality, poverty.	Aung San Suu Kyi	attitude
Crime is terribly revealing. Try and vary your methods as you will, your tastes, your habits, your attitude of mind, and your soul is revealed by your actions.	Agatha Christie	attitude
Solidarity is an attitude of resistance, I suppose, or it should be.	Christopher Hitchens	attitude
Americans are the most generous country on the planet. I've worked in Europe, I've worked in Australia. There is no where else where you get absolutely no attitude for being a foreigner. If you do your job well, they embrace you.	Hugh Jackman	attitude
When I go to the clinic next and sit with a tube in my arm and watch the poison go in, I'm in an attitude of abject passivity. It doesn't feel like fighting at all it just feels like submitting.	Christopher Hitchens	attitude
I separated from the Southern Baptists when they adopted the discriminatory attitude towards women, because I believe what Paul taught in Galatians that there is no distinction in God's eyes between men and women, slaves and masters, Jews and non-Jews - everybody is created equally in the eyes of God.	Jimmy Carter	attitude
I keep guitars that are, you know, the neck's a little bit bent and it's a little bit out of tune. I want to work and battle it and conquer it and make it express whatever attitude I have at that moment. I want it to be a struggle.	Jack White	attitude
It's sort of a mental attitude about critical thinking and curiosity. It's about mindset of looking at the world in a playful and curious and creative way.	Adam Savage	attitude
I have this theory that, depending on your attitude, your life doesn't have to become this ridiculous charade that it seems so many people end up living.	Christian Bale	attitude
It was just like a dream. I could have ended up with an album that's not all that different from anything else coming out of Nashville. Mutt made the difference. He took these songs, my attitude, my creativity, and colored them in a way that is unique.	Shania Twain	attitude
Not every religion has to have St. Augustine's attitude to sex. Why even in our culture marriages are celebrated in a church, everyone present knows what is going to happen that night, but that doesn't prevent it being a religious ceremony.	Ludwig Wittgenstein	attitude
I don't mean this in a stuck-up way, but I needed an attitude song.	Gwen Stefani	attitude

Christian Bale	attitude
My attitude is, do as much as I can while I'm free. And if I'm arrested I'll still do as much as I can.	Aung San Suu Kyi	attitude

We assume that we've come so far as compassionate citizens of the world if we do choose to read the news, yet the attitude towards life can be one where we put blinders on and forget that there are civil wars going on.

I film quite a bit of footage, then edit. Changes before your eyes, things you can do and things you can't. My attitude is always 'let it keep rolling.'	Terrence Malick	attitude

You may not realize it when it happens, but a kick in the teeth may be the best thing in the world for you.	Walt Disney	best

If you believe in what you are doing, then let nothing hold you up in your work. Much of the best work of the world has been done against seeming impossibilities. The thing is to get the work done.	Dale Carnegie	best
I know my country has not perfected itself. At times, we've struggled to keep the promise of liberty and equality for all of our people. We've made our share of mistakes, and there are times when our actions around the world have not lived up to our best intentions.	Barack Obama	best
So let's not use a stylus. We're going to use the best pointing device in the world. We're going to use a pointing device that we're all born with - born with ten of them.

As soon as someone tells me: 'You're rather sexy,' I wish I could disappear. If somebody says: 'You were voted the world's sexiest man,' I have no idea what that means. How do I respond? 'Thank you' is the best you can do. George Clooney is the world's sexiest man, anyway.	Daniel Craig	best

The first mistake in public business is the going into it.	Benjamin Franklin	business

Let your Discourse with Men of Business be Short and Comprehensive.	George Washington	business

Microsoft has had two goals in the last 10 years. One was to copy the Mac, and the other was to copy Lotus' success in the spreadsheet - basically, the applications business.

In this business, by the time you realize you're in trouble, it's too late to save yourself. Unless you're running scared all the time, you're gone.	Bill Gates	business

Business and growing jobs is about taking risk, sometimes failing, sometimes succeeding, but always striving. It is about dreams. Usually, it doesn't work out exactly as you might have imagined. Steve Jobs was fired at Apple. He came back and changed the world.	Mitt Romney	business
In almost every profession - whether it's law or journalism, finance or medicine or academia or running a small business - people rely on confidential communications to do their jobs.

This is a fantastic time to be entering the business world, because business is going to change more in the next 10 years than it has in the last 50.	Bill Gates	business
You know, out-of-touch liberals like Barack Obama say they want a strong economy, but in everything they do, they show they don't like business very much.

Business opportunities are like buses, there's always another one coming.	Richard Branson	business
The business schools reward difficult complex behavior more than simple behavior, but simple behavior is more effective.	Warren Buffett	business

If a business does well, the stock eventually follows.	Warren Buffett	business
And fifth, we will champion small businesses, America's engine of job growth. That means reducing taxes on business, not raising them. It means simplifying and modernizing the regulations that hurt small business the most. And it means that we must rein in the skyrocketing cost of healthcare by repealing and replacing Obamacare.	Mitt Romney	business
I know what it's like to start a business. I know how extra ordinarily difficult it is to build something from nothing. I know how government kills jobs and, yes, I know how it can help from time- to-time.	Mitt Romney	business

No person will make a great business who wants to do it all himself or get all the credit.	Andrew Carnegie	business
Mental fight means thinking against the current, not with it. It is our business to puncture gas bags and discover the seeds of truth.	Virginia Woolf	business
So we really need jobs now. We have to take jobs away from other countries because other countries are taking our jobs. There is practically not a country that does business with the United States that isn't making - let's call it a very big profit. I mean China is going to make $300 billion on us at least this year.	Donald Trump	business
But I believe in fair trade, and I will tell you, I have many, many friends heading up corporations, and people that do just business in China, they say it's virtually impossible. It's very, very hard to come into China. And yet, we welcome them with open arms.	Donald Trump	business
The average bright young man who is drafted hates the whole business because an army always tries to eliminate the individual differences in men.	Andy Rooney	business
To me, business isn't about wearing suits or pleasing stockholders. It's about being true to yourself, your ideas and focusing on the essentials.	Richard Branson	business
Business underlies everything in our national life, including our spiritual life. Witness the fact that in the Lord's Prayer, the first petition is for daily bread. No one can worship God or love his neighbor on an empty stomach.	Woodrow Wilson	business

My philosophy is: It's none of my business what people say of me and think of me.	Anthony Hopkins	business
It's like you always have to put on a happy face, be the phony baloney, and I'm so not that. I never was that I'll never be that. That is part of the business that I don't like. Maybe that will always keep me an outsider, I don't know. But that's fine.	Chloe Sevigny	business
Business, you know, may bring you money, but friendship hardly ever does.	Jane Austen	business
I think a simple rule of business is, if you do the things that are easier first, then you can actually make a lot of progress.	Mark Zuckerberg	business
I strongly believe that missionaries make better products. They care more. For a missionary, it's not just about the business.

Good business leaders create a vision, articulate the vision, passionately own the vision, and relentlessly drive it to completion.	Jack Welch	business
I'm someone who loves to enjoy life and tries to focus on real things and real friendships. That's why I live very simply. I'm a jeans and T-shirt kind of girl.

Cameron Diaz	business
Almost anyone can be an author the business is to collect money and fame from this state of being.	A. A. Milne	business
I started out mopping floors, waiting tables, and tending bar at my dad's tavern. I put myself through school working odd jobs and night shifts. I poured my heart and soul into a small business. And when I saw how out-of-touch Washington had become with the core values of this great nation, I put my name forward and ran for office.	John Boehner	business
For the first time we're allowing developers who don't work at Facebook to develop applications just as if they were. That's a big deal because it means that all developers have a new way of doing business if they choose to take advantage of it. There are whole companies that are forming whose only product is a Facebook Platform application.	Mark Zuckerberg	business
I feel lazy when I'm not working. I learned all my business sense from my dad. He always believed in me, and I think the last thing he said to me before he passed away was, 'I know you're gonna be OK. I'm not worried about you'.	Kim Kardashian	business
There is one other business where the customer is always wrong and that's the media.	Rush Limbaugh	business
To keep the record straight, it wasn't always John and Yoko. We've all accused one another of various business things we tend to be pretty paranoid by now, as you can imagine. There's a lot of money involved.	Paul McCartney	business

I'm not asking any of you to make drastic changes to every single one of your recipes or to totally change the way you do business. But what I am asking is that you consider reformulating your menu in pragmatic and incremental ways to create healthier versions of the foods that we all love.	Michelle Obama	business
Leave the President's family business to him. You will have plenty to do without trying to manage the First Family. They are likely to do fine without your help.	Donald Rumsfeld	business
Duty is the great business of a sea officer all private considerations must give way to it, however painful it may be.	Horatio Nelson	business

I never really studied business in school. I kind of wish I had, but how boring is that?	Mick Jagger	business

Whatever I do, it's my business. It's not my job to parent America.	Christina Aguilera	business
You know, I think the film business is its own worst enemy because it sells movies on DVD footage and 'behind the scenes,' and now it's a real struggle trying to keep storylines and plotlines a secret.	Daniel Craig	business
I think all women in Hollywood are known as sex symbols. That's what our purpose is in this business. You're merchandised, you're a product. You're sold and it's based on sex. But that's okay. I think women should be empowered by that, not degraded.	Megan Fox	business
I'm trying to build a strong business. I want to create new stars, new shows and new products for my audience and create a legacy that outlives me. There are so many other ways I want to reach women besides doing a talk show.	Tyra Banks	business
It can be hard in this business, especially when you're very young, to figure out who you can and can't trust.	Christina Aguilera	business
It's been a joy to be a part of other people's journey, to be able to inspire and be a part of new singers coming up in this business.	Christina Aguilera	business
I'm not a kid. You don't get in this business for anonymity. It's not like I have posters of myself on the wall, but at the same time, I'm kind of ready for a little bit of it, but I worry for my little one, and my family - their privacy. That's what I'm more protective of.	Hugh Jackman	business
I'm a mad lover of sport. You cannot say a bad word to me about sports. So I know business is involved and I know it can be cynical, and, of course, I watch it, but for me it's pure.	Hugh Jackman	business
At the end of drama school, I made a contract with myself: I'd try acting for five years. I was 26. I had already spent eight years working in restaurants and gas stations. So I had seen enough small businesses to understand that that's what acting is: a small business.	Hugh Jackman	business
When I've gone back to work, it's always with that sense of inevitability. That may be a complete delusion, but it's the one that I need to get out of bed and go about my business. That sense that I can't avoid this thing. I better just get on with it.	Daniel Day-Lewis	business
After a while of getting jerked around, you realize what the business is really made up of.	Tori Amos	business
People assume that all artists make for terrible business people, but I'm in complete charge of my own career.	Tori Amos	business
There's a side to this industry that nurtures divas who can't write. It's a big business.	Tori Amos	business
The business side of film has goofed up so many things, but even that's changing. It happened to the music industry and now it's happening to the film studios. It's crazy what's going on. But artists should have control of their work especially if, as I always say, you never turn down a good idea and never take a bad idea.	David Lynch	business
I never get the accountants in before I start up a business. It's done on gut feeling, especially if I can see that they are taking the mickey out of the consumer.	Richard Branson	business

The Internet is the Viagra of big business.	Jack Welch	business
Like sex in Victorian England, the reality of Big Business today is our big dirty secret.	Ralph Nader	business
Really, I have to laugh because there was a whole set of stories that made me sound like the Dragon Lady, you know, 'tough this and tough that.' Then there is this business about 'gooey.' The bottom line is I am a pragmatic idealist.	Madeleine Albright	business
Many people would no more think of entering journalism than the sewage business - which at least does us all some good.	Stephen Fry	business
I'm very free-spirited and crazy. I love to have fun, and I like doing stupid things. At the same time, I'm like a 35-year-old. I have a house. I have a car. I have a steady job. I have a business, and I have to make serious decisions.	Avril Lavigne	business
I started the site when I was 19. I didn't know much about business back then.	Mark Zuckerberg	business
The common question that gets asked in business is, 'why?' That's a good question, but an equally valid question is, 'why not?'	Jeff Bezos	business
Most of my relationships were people in the business. Having said that, me and Tim don't really talk that much about work. He comes into my bit of the house every so often to vent but we don't really have very high, cultured conversations.	Helena Bonham Carter	business
Short cycle business are being impacted by credit, and are being impacted by gasoline prices, food, distribution businesses, chemical business.	Jack Welch	business
There's no business like show business, but there are several businesses like accounting.	David Letterman	business

Teenage girls these days are more and more getting lured into thinking they should dumb themselves down, and that's going to attract the wrong kind of guy, and it's serious. It's serious business.	Danica McKellar	business
The camera fails to capture the 'business' in show business! We typically will give 10 percent of our salary to the agent, 10 percent to the manager, and 5 percent to the lawyer, plus the publicist gets a flat fee, which needs to be budgeted for.	Danica McKellar	business
I feel fine, I don't care who the director is. All you have to do is know what your doing - all of us - everybody in the business - that's all you ask anyone - you know your job, I know mine, let's go do it.	Morgan Freeman	business
I think people are used to seeing actors be wide open and desperately giving of themselves, and while I do that on a movie set as much as I can, it's so unnatural for me to do it on television, in interviews, in anything like that. I also don't find that my process as an actor is really anyone else's business.	Kristen Stewart	business
I am a child but I have to think and act like a woman, this business forces you to.	Rihanna	business
I was a good amateur but only an average professional. I soon realized that there was a limit to how far I could rise in the music business, so I left the band and enrolled at New York University.	Alan Greenspan	business
One thing is certain in business. You and everyone around you will make mistakes.	Richard Branson	business
My view is that you still, in order to win from the Labour perspective, have to have a strong alliance with business as well as the unions. You have got to be very much in the centre ground on things like public sector reform.	Tony Blair	business
Desperation is the perfume of the young actor. It's so satisfying to have gotten rid of it. If you keep smelling it, it can drive you crazy. In this business a lot of people go nuts, go eccentric, even end up dead from it. Not my plan.	Uma Thurman	business
I still have a lot to learn - about the business, about music, and about myself. Its exciting.	Britney Spears	business
Suits are looked at more now as a business thing which is kind of a shame. If you're not wearing it just for work, you should try and trick it up a bit.	Daniel Craig	business
I genuinely believe that if you want to get in the film business, get in the film business.	Daniel Craig	business
My goal in the beginning was to buy my mother a house. Now I realize, okay, if I really focus and become a key player in business, then I can build an empire.	Nicki Minaj	business
Female rappers get it the hardest. You have to be a girl, yet you have to be just as hard as the guys. I think some female rappers get scared out of the business before they can make it.	Nicki Minaj	business
It's not hard to get your way when it's your way or the highway. People either follow suit or they're not around. I don't really like the sound of that, 'cause that sounds like a temper tantrum. I'm just very black and white when it comes to my business. There's really no gray area.	Nicki Minaj	business
Planning cities is a necessary but risky business.	Cate Blanchett	business
I am just at that stage of wondering where I go from here. I came into this business almost by accident, but now it has become serious. What started as a bit of fun, something to do other than be a model, has taken on a different career curve. I have been forced to ask where that curve is going to end up.	Cameron Diaz	business
I think early on I knew what I was going to do and it was based a lot on familiarity but it was also because I didn't have a lot of skills. There was nothing I wanted t be. I didn't want to be a doctor. I wanted to be in show business.	Christopher Walken	business
I think that if I had grown up and had been in show business and the movies twenty five, thirty years earlier, I think I would have made a lot more musical movies.	Christopher Walken	business
I think the fact that I was raised in show business, in New York City, in the '50s, that's affected my personality to the point that I'm a little different.	Christopher Walken	business
Well, I was sort of a jack-of-all-trades in show business for a long time. I was a singer and a dancer and then I got a job as an actor.	Christopher Walken	business
I've made movies that I thought were good. I've made movies that I thought were okay, but then I was very good. And sometimes you're in a movie and you think, I wish more people saw that - because you're good. And it just works out that the movie gets lost. But that's show business.	Christopher Walken	business
The more you are in this business, the more humbled by it you become.	Meryl Streep	business
Show business has been really, really good to me because I can work and take a lot of time off, and I'm extremely undisciplined person.	Meryl Streep	business
There are two ways to extend a business. Take inventory of what you're good at and extend out from your skills. Or determine what your customers need and work backward, even if it requires learning new skills. Kindle is an example of working backward.	Jeff Bezos	business
It's not just Bin Laden or just those that are involved in the counterterrorism effort. We've gotta cast the net broader than that. But I think it's a - very special tribute that we all owe to the bravery and courage of the men and women in the intelligence and military business who performed so well to finally get it done.	Dick Cheney	business
America's political system has evolved over the last 50 years in ways that have enhanced the power of business lobbies.	Al Gore	business
The whole point of being in this business and being blessed and being successful is that you're able to do things for your friends or your family, which means that they can have something special in their lives, too.	Elton John	business
And I trusted someone to look after me on the business side of life.	Elton John	business
As an actor you have to wait for someone to cast you, so you're relying on the business.	Mia Wasikowska	business
It never made sense to me that someone would achieve any kind of success in show business, only to become a jerk.	Josh Radnor	business
I may be kindly, I am ordinarily gentle, but in my line of business I am obliged to will terribly what I will at all.	Catherine the Great	business
Just because you've made a couple movies, you've done some good movies, you've been nominated for some Academy Awards, whatever, nobody's entitled. It's a business. If they don't see it, I can think they're wrong, but I'm not entitled to a $15 million budget to make a film.	Edward Norton	business
I've managed to keep a clear head and remain sane in this business because I remain a kid off-camera.	Leonardo DiCaprio	business
Some people work hard in this business and become really popular, really big stars but they never receive an award from within the business. Somehow, when your colleagues and friends believe in you to the point of handing you an award it means so much more.	Sharon Stone	business
But the reason I became, why I wanted to be in the business was because there was Midnight Cowboy.	Jodie Foster	business
I used to be focused on being the dopest rapper in the game, and then once that became what I was, I wanted something different, and I wanted to become the best businessman in the game. I wanted to learn how to master the business like I mastered the rap.	Snoop Dogg	business
The most important decision I've made in business? The choices of people I have around me. When I first started I brought everybody with me, my homies from the neighborhood, criminals. I just said, 'Come on everybody, we made it.' Then I had to realize we didn't make it. I made it.	Snoop Dogg	business
Our marriage is between us. If we decide to continue being together or not, it's our business.	Gwyneth Paltrow	business
I was a fairly good amateur musician, and I was an average professional. But the one thing I saw was that the big band business was fading.	Alan Greenspan	business
I mean, I'm in the business of storytelling, not message making.	John le Carre	business
We expect all our businesses to have a positive impact on our top and bottom lines. Profitability is very important to us or we wouldn't be in this business.	Jeff Bezos	business
If you don't understand the details of your business you are going to fail.	Jeff Bezos	business
We have to make America the best place in the world to do business.	Dick Cheney	business

Our competition for American business is no longer in the next county or the next state, it's around the world.	Karl Rove	business
If GM had kept up with technology like the computer industry has, we would all be driving $25 cars that got 1,000 MPG.	Bill Gates	car
I hooked up my accelerator pedal in my car to my brake lights. I hit the gas, people behind me stop, and I'm gone.	Steven Wright	car
I replaced the headlights in my car with strobe lights, so it looks like I'm the only one moving.	Steven Wright	car
I had to stop driving my car for a while... the tires got dizzy.	Steven Wright	car
Ikea people do not drive flashy cars or stay at luxury hotels.	Ingvar Kamprad	car
America... just a nation of two hundred million used car salesmen with all the money we need to buy guns and no qualms about killing anybody else in the world who tries to make us uncomfortable.	Hunter S. Thompson	car
A man who has never gone to school may steal from a freight car but if he has a university education, he may steal the whole railroad.	Theodore Roosevelt	car
Most people have no concept of how an automatic transmission works, yet they know how to drive a car. You don't have to study physics to understand the laws of motion to drive a car. You don't have to understand any of this stuff to use Macintosh.	Steve Jobs	car
I miss Saturday morning, rolling out of bed, not shaving, getting into my car with my girls, driving to the supermarket, squeezing the fruit, getting my car washed, taking walks.	Barack Obama	car

I rememeber one time we were getting ready to go to South America and everything was packed up and in the car ready to go and I hid and I was crying because I really did not want to go, I wanted to play. I did not want to go.	Michael Jackson	car
I play the harmonica. The only way I can play is if I get my car going really fast, and stick it out the window.	Steven Wright	car
I have bad reflexes. I was once run over by a car being pushed by two guys.	Woody Allen	car
When you first get money, you buy all these things so no one thinks you're mean, and you spread it around. You get a chauffeur and you find yourself thrown around the back of this car and you think, I was happier when I had my own little car! I could drive myself!	Paul McCartney	car
Design can never be an ultimate explanation for anything. It can only be a proximate explanation. A plane or a car is explained by a designer but that's because the designer himself, the engineer, is explained by natural selection.	Richard Dawkins	car
I know people think we drive around in these nice cars and we do whatever we want and our parents will pay our credit cards, but that's not the case. Sure, my parents were generous I got a nice car at 16, but at 18 I was cut off. I've worked really hard. I opened the store myself.	Kim Kardashian	car
White is actually one of my favorite colors. I have a white car. I love white.	Kim Kardashian	car
Shutting off the thought process is not rejuvenating the mind is like a car battery - it recharges by running.	Bill Watterson	car
The first real thought that I had of something that I might do was to write for car magazines, because I always had a car thing.	Jerry Seinfeld	car
To this day, I am the least materialistic person I know, because my father didn't raise me to just go out and buy this or that car. The only reason I wanted to make money as an actor was because I'm passionate about food!	Hugh Jackman	car
I remember driving to North Carolina when I was a little girl in a snowstorm to get down to my mom's family in the Carolinas. There were chains on the car - it was the late sixties - and we were just singing in the car. Christmas carols.	Tori Amos	car
My parents were what I like to call proper musical fans. Lots of Sondheim was played in the car.	Daniel Radcliffe	car
I grew up listening to show tunes in the back of the car.	Daniel Radcliffe	car
People who have car collections - I never understood that. I always thought that was unnecessary. It's not beautiful, it's not creative. It's just showing how much money you've got.	Daniel Radcliffe	car
My mother was determined to make us independent. When I was four years old, she stopped the car a few miles from our house and made me find my own way home across the fields. I got hopelessly lost.	Richard Branson	car
John D. Rockefeller wanted to dominate oil, but Microsoft wants it all, you name it: cable, media, banking, car dealerships.	Ralph Nader	car
I accept the Old Testament as more of an action movie: blood, car chases, evacuations, a lot of special effects, seas dividing, mass murder, adultery. The children of God are running amok, wayward. Maybe that's why they're so relatable.	Bono	car
I was hit by a car once on my bike, but I still rode home.	Amy Winehouse	car
Fact: The new '90210' is cooler than the old '90210.' It's the lithe, streamlined Skipper to the elder series' venerable Barbie. Gone are the traditional parents - they've been replaced by a hipster mom n' pop who get busted necking in the car.	Diablo Cody	car
I look away at car crashes, and I know people who look away at car crashes, because it makes us uncomfortable to watch other people in pain.	John Mayer	car
I love sleeping in a moving car more than sleeping in bed.	Ben Stein	car
Consider what kind of car you get. Buy cars and other products that have the least impact environmentally.	Al Gore	car
If a movie is really working, you forget for two hours your Social Security number and where your car is parked. You are having a vicarious experience. You are identifying, in one way or another, with the people on the screen.	Roger Ebert	car
My mother gave me this book called Feature Films at Used Car Prices by a guy named Rick Schmidt. I gotta credit the guy, cuz he gave me the most practical advice. It empowers you.	Vin Diesel	car
I enjoy racing historic motorcars from the '50s and '60s. The seed of my interest was planted when I was about 12 years old and took over my mother's Morris Minor. I drove it around my father's farm. But my favorite car is still a McLaren F1, which I have had for 10 years.	Rowan Atkinson	car
When I was really little I would sit in the back of my dad's car when he'd be playing old-school music. He'd turn down the music and turn around and I'd be singing and know all of the words but I didn't even know how to talk. From then on I've always wanted to be a singer.	Leona Lewis	car
Before now, I've always taken my mixes out to the car and listened to them in the parking lot. I still do that, but more so now I'm listening to it on the Beat box, and I think people should give it at least a listen and check it out and see what it is.	Dr. Dre	car
I think the Smart Car is awesome. The only problem is I've been on the freeway and felt like I was going to be blown away like a Tim Hortons coffee cup, so I may have to upgrade to a Mini Cooper - something a little stronger.	Ellen Page	car
We each own one car, and we have a reasonable house. It's a lovely place to be, but it's not extravagant.	Reese Witherspoon	car
The thing about drugs and sex is that you lose all your inhibitions. I've had sex in trains, planes, wine bars... and quite a few car parks!	Robbie Williams	car
I would like you all to give me a round of applause as I have not crashed my car in over 15 months.	Matthew Perry	car
I'm like, 'Would you be the person in the room that would boo when Dylan went electric? I know I wouldn't. Or are you the person that left The Beatles after 'She Loves You,' or 'Drive My Car?' You weren't on board for 'Revolution 9' or 'Day In The Life,' were you?'	Regina Spektor	car
ER was one of my favourites. I played a car accident victim who has leukemia. I got to wear a neck brace and nose tubes for the two days I worked.	Dakota Fanning	car
You always hear the phrase, money doesn't buy you happiness. But I always in the back of my mind figured a lot of money will buy you a little bit of happiness. But it's not really true. I got a new car because the old one's lease expired.	Sergey Brin	car
Yeah, well I think anyone who likes fast cars will love the Tesla. And it has fantastic handling by the way. I mean this car will crush a Porsche on the track, just crush it. So if you like fast cars, you'll love this car. And then oh, by the way, it happens to be electric and it's twice the efficiency of a Prius.	Elon Musk	car
The alarm rings 4:45, again at 5, but I wake up 4:30 naturally. Shower, shave, orange juice, perk my own coffee, hear the news, and the CBS car arrives 5:30.	Charlie Rose	car
Normally in dangerous situations I have a getaway car.	Sacha Baron Cohen	car

I have to struggle to change people's perceptions of me. I grew very frustrated with the perception that I'm this shy, retiring, inhibited aristocratic creature when I'm absolutely not like that at all. I think I'm much more outgoing and exuberant than my image.	Helena Bonham Carter	change
I change my mind so much I need two boyfriends and a girlfriend.	Pink	change

Computers are like Old Testament gods lots of rules and no mercy.	Joseph Campbell	computers
I think computer viruses should count as life. I think it says something about human nature that the only form of life we have created so far is purely destructive. We've created life in our own image.	Stephen Hawking	computers
Computers make it easier to do a lot of things, but most of the things they make it easier to do don't need to be done.	Andy Rooney	computers

I was afraid of the internet... because I couldn't type.	Jack Welch	computers

We're going to be able to ask our computers to monitor things for us, and when certain conditions happen, are triggered, the computers will take certain actions and inform us after the fact.	Steve Jobs	computers
This is what customers pay us for - to sweat all these details so it's easy and pleasant for them to use our computers. We're supposed to be really good at this. That doesn't mean we don't listen to customers, but it's hard for them to tell you what they want when they've never seen anything remotely like it.	Steve Jobs	computers
I just think people have a lot of fiction. But, you know, I mean, the real story of Facebook is just that we've worked so hard for all this time.

There is no heaven or afterlife for broken-down computers that is a fairy story for people afraid of the dark.	Stephen Hawking	computers

I'm from Iowa, we don't know what cool is!	Ashton Kutcher	cool
I don't think of myself as hot or cool or anything, just a dork.	Ashley Olsen	cool
I'm a mirror. If you're cool with me, I'm cool with you, and the exchange starts. What you see is what you reflect. If you don't like what you see, then you've done something. If I'm standoffish, that's because you are.	Jay-Z	cool
The cool thing about being famous is traveling. I have always wanted to travel across seas, like to Canada and stuff.	Britney Spears	cool

What people don't understand is joining a gang ain't bad, it's cool, it's fine. When you in the hood, joining a gang it's cool because all your friends are in the gang, all your family's in the gang. We're not just killing people every night, we're just hanging out, having a good time.	Snoop Dogg	cool
Where I come from it was really unheard of to be at a party and someone says, 'What kind of music do you make?', and you say, 'Pop music.' You may as well have 'I'm not cool' stamped on your forehead.	Lady Gaga	cool
Racism is taught in the home. We agree on that? Well, it's very hard to teach racism to a teenager who's listening to rap music and who idolizes, say, Snoop Dogg. It's hard to say, 'That guy is less than you.' The kid is like, 'I like that guy, he's cool. How is he less than me?	Jay-Z	cool
It's cool when fans spend so much time making things for me. It means a lot.	Justin Bieber	cool
I don't go to the cool, trendy restaurants. I go to either the holes in the wall or the super-fancy restaurants where there are no cool people.	Tyra Banks	cool
I think people appreciate a songwriter who shows different sides. The whole angst thing is cool, but if that's all you've got, it's just boring. Everything I write, whether it's happy or sad, has a sense of humor to it.	Katy Perry	cool
I remember being on film sets when I was younger, and only men got to do the cool action movies. So I thought, 'Maybe I'll get to produce one day and get to do cool stuff too,' which is what happened when we did 'Charlie's Angels.' Starting my production company was a big turning point for me.	Drew Barrymore	cool
I grew up not really having anything, so the idea that I can take care of my family and my friends now is a really cool bonus.	Katy Perry	cool
I once sang 'Summer Nights,' from 'Grease,' at a bar in Melbourne with John Travolta, who's a good friend of mine. He looked cool singing the part of Danny - sitting in an armchair, smoking a cigar - while I got stuck playing Sandy.	Hugh Jackman	cool

The nerds are the ones that make the films and do loads of other really cool stuff in their life.	Daniel Radcliffe	cool

I didn't watch much TV as a kid and I don' t watch it now. I don' t find anything beautiful or unique to the medium, and the only thing you can do on TV that you can't do in film is make a continuing story - which is so cool!	David Lynch	cool
If a guy is skilled at anything, that's attractive. There's something very primal about that and, sure, it can be as simple as figuring out the tip quickly. It's really cool when a guy tips 20 percent quickly and effortlessly so that when the check comes, he opens it and signs his name and done.	Danica McKellar	cool
My friends are people who like building cool stuff. We always have this joke about people who want to just start companies without making something valuable. There's a lot of that in Silicon Valley.	Mark Zuckerberg	cool
I really, specifically, love acting, and I think it's a really cool thing to be really indulgent and follow that.

It's really cool when a guy tips 20 per cent quickly and effortlessly so that when the check comes, he opens it and signs his name and done.	Danica McKellar	cool

I really, specifically, love acting, and I think it's a really cool thing to be really indulgent and follow that. I have a lot of ambitions in life, but for the next few years, I just want to be an actor.	Kristen Stewart	cool
I used to be a cool chick but I'm not anymore.	Britney Spears	cool
Cynicism is kind of like folding your arms and stepping back and commenting on things, like the old guys in 'The Muppets,' just throwing out comments all the time, whereas there are other people on the ground really trying to affect things and improve their lives and the lives of other people. I think it's noble and I think it's cool.	Josh Radnor	cool
I haven't left the house without a packet of Kleenex in my back pocket for as long as I can remember. Whenever I start thinking I'm incredibly cool, the packet of Kleenex in my back pocket brings me right back down to earth.	Josh Radnor	cool
There aren't many poster children for cool angst. Everybody thinks it's cool if you're the bad girl.	Fiona Apple	cool
How serious can a movie about time-traveling robots be? You want it to be cool and fun.	Christian Bale	cool
Australia is so cool that it's hard to even know where to start describing it. The beaches are beautiful so is the weather. Not too crowded. Great food, great music, really nice people. It must be a lot like Los Angeles was many years ago.	Mary-Kate Olsen	cool
Justin Timberlake is everything, and what more could you want in a person? He's funny. He's cute. He's great. He just understands. I get him and he gets me, and that's cool.	Britney Spears	cool
It's hard to encapsulate my inspiration because there are so many different looks, but I think it's just like, sexy girl you see walking down the street in a cool outfit. A lot of eyelet, a lot of leather, playing with the hard and the soft, the good and bad inside of us all.	Chloe Sevigny	cool
If I wasn't even famous or had any success, I would still wake up and put tons of make-up on, and put on a cool outfit. That's always been who I've been my whole life, so that's never gonna change. I love fashion. I love getting dressed up. I love Halloween, too.	Gwen Stefani	cool
I'd love to date somebody cool, fun, funny.	Rihanna	cool
The second I met Zac, I thought he was a really cool guy. It's hard not to have chemistry with someone who is so attractive.	Vanessa Hudgens	cool
Being cool, having a 'cool' energy is just not attractive to me.	Selena Gomez	cool
I think fashion is a lot of fun. I love clothes. More than fashion or brand labels, I love design. I love the thought that people put into clothes.

In my teens, I was never part of the cool crowd.	Jennifer Garner	cool
Personally, I was never the cool kid. I was always sort of a bookworm. I would just like to be more like Troy, because he's so cool.	Zac Efron	cool
Personally, I was never the cool kid. I was always sort of a bookworm.	Zac Efron	cool
Spider-Man's probably my favorite. You see, Batman is a billionaire and there's nothing really cool about a billionaire saving the world. But Spider-Man is Peter Parker, a conflicted character who puts on a suit and saves the world. I love that.	Zac Efron	cool
My whole thing is that I want to explore why you read books, what's the purpose of reading, and maybe that it's not that cool to hate something just because it's popular.	Josh Radnor	cool

Growing up, politics never trickled down to the areas we come from. But people from Obama's camp, and Obama himself, reached out to me and asked for my help on the campaign. We've sat and had dinner, and we've spoken on the phone. He's a very sharp guy. Very charming. Very cool.	Jay-Z	cool
You make your first album, you make some money, and you feel like you still have to show face, like 'I still go to the projects.' I'm like, why? Your job is to inspire people from your neighborhood to get out. You grew up there. What makes you think it's so cool?	Jay-Z	cool
Most of the time you're too busy to think about it. But every now and then you say, 'I work at 'Saturday Night Live,' and that is so cool.	Tina Fey	cool
I wanted to escape Small Town U.S.A. To dismiss the boundaries, to explore. My life experience came from watching movies, TV, and reading books and magazines. When your culture comes from watching TV everyday, you're bombarded with images of things that seem cool, places that seem interesting, people who have jobs and careers and opportunities.	Trent Reznor	cool
But acting is very much a profession that is you're hot one moment and not the next - and that is totally cool. I think that's what I find most fascinating and most exciting about it - is that it can be gone in a puff of smoke.	Keira Knightley	cool
That was cool and that sucked all at the same time.	Adam Savage	cool
What's weird is that I work with these directors and then I start channeling them. I kind of turn into them a bit - which is cool when you're working with Clint Eastwood.	Jamie Bell	cool
I'd love to be an artist that's multifaceted. At the moment, I am not. But wouldn't that be cool if I was like, 'Yeah, let me pull out my guitar and play you a song.' I would adore that. I am so far not gifted in that way. But I am a very hard worker and a very determined person, so who knows?	Anne Hathaway	cool
What's cool about indie rock is that one band can do effectively the same thing as another band, and one band nails it, and the other one doesn't. I like that elusiveness.	Andrew Bird	cool

The idea of recognising your strengths and using them in as versatile a way as you can is cool to me.	Frank Ocean	cool

You have to be the best of whatever you are, but successful, cool actresses come in all shapes and sizes.	Jessica Alba	cool
There's a power in women being women. There's a role for men, but we don't have to be men, because we're women. I think that representing that on television is a cool thing.	Jenna Elfman	cool
Men, when they fight in movies, it's a very different style. Harrison Ford was so cool when he had the whip, and Bruce Lee was such an artist that you couldn't take your eyes off of him.	Lucy Liu	cool
It was really really neat to make the movie because there were mentally challenged actors in the movie. So that was really really cool to work with them and they were always really happy, and they made everybody really happy on the set too.	Dakota Fanning	cool
Courtney Love is really cool and funny. I would like to meet Julia Roberts and Cameron Diaz. I think I could play their daughters.	Dakota Fanning	cool

Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.	Steve Jobs	courage

And my dad, you're a great actor but you're a better father.	Angelina Jolie	dad
I've got high standards when it comes to boys. As my dad says, all girls should! I'm from the South - Tennessee, to be exact - and down there, we're all about southern hospitality. I know that if I like a guy, he better be nice, and above all, my dad has to approve of him!	Miley Cyrus	dad
Don't force your kids into sports. I never was. To this day, my dad has never asked me to go play golf. I ask him. It's the child's desire to play that matters, not the parent's desire to have the child play. Fun. Keep it fun.	Tiger Woods	dad
I always wanted what Mom and Dad had.	Kim Kardashian	dad
My dad is still Christian Scientist. My mom's not, and I'm not. But I believe in God, and that there's a higher power and an intelligence that's bigger than us and that we can rely on. It's not just us, thinking we are the ones in control of everything. That idea gives me support.	Ellen DeGeneres	dad
My dad raised me with some good advice: 'Always tell the truth. Always shoot from the hip. You might not have many friends, but you'll never have enemies, because people will always know where you're coming from.'	Pink	dad

My dad, bless him, was a musician. And his dad had thought that his music was rubbish.	Paul McCartney	dad
I'm a pretty hands-on dad and make the most of my custody. I take care of my little one whenever I can, and she determines what I can do and where I can do it.	Paul McCartney	dad
When I was younger, my family would go camping and fishing on our ranches. My dad loves being around all kinds of animals. He's the one who got me to be a really big animal lover.	Paris Hilton	dad
Where I come from, you don't really talk about how much you're earning. Those things are private. My dad never told my mum how much he was earning. I'm certainly not going to tell the world. I'm doing well.	Paul McCartney	dad
My dad was a particularly polite kind of guy, very courteous.	Paul McCartney	dad
Looking back, I think I was always musical. My dad was very musical, and I think my mom was musical.	Paul McCartney	dad
I'm very at ease, and I like it. I never thought I would be such a family-oriented guy I didn't think that was part of my makeup. But somebody said that as you get older you become the person you always should have been, and I feel that's happening to me. I'm rather surprised at who I am, because I'm actually like my dad!	David Bowie	dad
I get that same queasy, nervous, thrilling feeling every time I go to work. That's never worn off since I was 12 years-old with my dad's 8-millimeter movie camera.	Steven Spielberg	dad
My dad took me to my first movie.	Steven Spielberg	dad
And I saw the sax line-up that he had behind him and I thought, I'm going to learn the saxophone. When I grow up, I'm going to play in his band. So I sort of persuaded my dad to get me a kind of a plastic saxophone on the hire purchase plan.	David Bowie	dad
I love being a dad. I just love it.	Jerry Seinfeld	dad
I wanted to be a skinny little ballerina but I was a voluptuous little Italian girl whose dad had meatballs on the table every night.	Lady Gaga	dad
My dad became a soap opera actor, and I was an extra in a skating rink scene on the soap. I didn't audition. It was nepotism all the way.	Jennifer Aniston	dad
There is nothing that would upset me more than my dad being bribed by the press. It's like, 'Just let them run it, then. Don't you give them ammunition.'	Adele	dad
Great dad. Yeah, he would ask me for money on birthdays and, you know, inappropriate times. And I just wrote him off like, 'You're not a father.' I just learned you cannot emotionally invest in people who are not attainable.	Drew Barrymore	dad
Now I meditate twice a day for half an hour. In meditation, I can let go of everything. I'm not Hugh Jackman. I'm not a dad. I'm not a husband. I'm just dipping into that powerful source that creates everything. I take a little bath in it.	Hugh Jackman	dad
One afternoon when I was 9, my dad told me I'd be skipping school the next day. Then we drove 12 hours from Melbourne to Sydney for the Centenary Test, a once-in-a-lifetime commemorative cricket match. It was great fun - especially for a kid who was a massive sports fan.	Hugh Jackman	dad
I want to be a young dad. By 25 or 26 I want to see myself, like, married or start looking for a family.	Justin Bieber	dad
My friends say, 'Man you're going to have kids sleeping on pillowcases with your face on it! You're going to be on toothbrushes and magnets and stuff.' I guess now that I'm a dad, I'm thrilled about that.	Hugh Jackman	dad
My kids are not that interested in my movie career, by the way. My son, in particular, never talks about it. He just wants me as his dad.	Hugh Jackman	dad
I've never heard my dad say a bad word about anybody. He always keeps his emotions in check and is a true gentleman. I was taught that losing it was indulgent, a selfish act.	Hugh Jackman	dad
My dad used to say, 'Just because you dress up in a coat and tie, it doesn't influence your intelligence.'	Tiger Woods	dad
I'm not a religious person. My mom was of Jewish blood and my dad was Protestant.	Daniel Radcliffe	dad
My dad believes in God, I think. I'm not sure if my mom does. I don't.	Daniel Radcliffe	dad

My dad would give me $10, which is a lot of money when you're 9, to sing at church, on tables at restaurants, at family functions, just about anywhere.	Katy Perry	dad
I think my dad is a lot cooler than other dads. He still acts like he's still 17.	Miley Cyrus	dad
My dad says I could sing before I could talk, if that's possible. I was always humming and things like that.	Miley Cyrus	dad
I once said to my father, when I was a boy, 'Dad we need a third political party.' He said to me, 'I'll settle for a second.'	Ralph Nader	dad
My dad always used to tell me that if they challenge you to an after-school fight, tell them you won't wait-you can kick their ass right now.	Cameron Diaz	dad
Overcoming my dad telling me that I could never amount to anything is what has made me the megalomaniac that you see today.	Bono	dad
My dad always said, 'Champ, the measure of a man is not how often he is knocked down, but how quickly he gets up.'	Joe Biden	dad
I have four shelves covered with journals that I've written. Dad and I are writing songs together. I've probably written 100 songs.	Miley Cyrus	dad
I probably have an earlier curfew than anyone. My mom wants to keep me really safe and my dad's not overly protective, but he's a dad no matter what.	Miley Cyrus	dad
I'm the whitest guy you will ever meet. The first time I saw an African-American, my dad had to tell me to stop staring.	Glenn Beck	dad
When I was little, we had a Golden Book that had all these Disney characters in one portrait on the first page. My dad used to read from it every night. We'd play this game of find Pluto or find Donald Duck. He'd read us stories and do all the voices. Those are great memories.	Danica McKellar	dad
My dad takes care of me as a manager and as a dad. That's his job, you know, to take care of me. He has my best interests at heart.	Jessica Simpson	dad
I can talk to my dad like he's my manager, and put 'Dad' on the back burner. We've been doing it since I was 13.	Jessica Simpson	dad
My dad's a doctor, and when I was 8, I went to one of his medical conferences where they were demonstrating laser surgery on a chicken. I was so mad that a chicken had to die, I never ate meat again.	Natalie Portman	dad
When I was in nursery school, the teachers asked me, y'know, 'What does your dad do for a living?' So I said 'He helps women get pregnant!' They called my mom and they were like, 'What exactly does your husband do?'	Natalie Portman	dad
My dad was a militant atheist, or is a militant atheist. My mum was sort of bought up in a religious family because she was a Protestant from Ireland but wasn't especially religious.	Tony Blair	dad
I have to remind my dad, 'Journalists - no matter how many cigars they smoke with you - are not your friends, so don't talk to them.'	Cameron Diaz	dad
My dad's probably one of the kindest people in the world. When I was younger that's not how I was- I was a little spoiled brat.	Leonardo DiCaprio	dad
Also for me it was different because I play a lot of villains and in this one I play a dad and I play a good guy, basically. He's the Secretary of the Treasury. I never had a job like that.	Christopher Walken	dad
My dad was the biggest influence on my life because he was never boring.	Christian Bale	dad
Look, I've got incredible pride for my family. I've absolutely fallen into that cliche of a dad who could just happily talk about my daughter endlessly.	Christian Bale	dad
My father came from a very poor background, but I was very fortunate in the sense that we were never in need. My dad was determined to make sure that we didn't want for things. He wanted to give us more opportunity than he had, a better shot at a better life.	Brad Pitt	dad
My mother taught public school, went to Harvard and then got her master's there and taught fifth and sixth grade in a public school. My dad had a more working-class lifestyle. He didn't go to college. He was an auto mechanic and a bartender and a janitor at Harvard.	Ben Affleck	dad
You do need parental guidance and I was in a great position with both my mum and dad. They split when I was a baby but even though I stayed with my mom they were both very much involved in my upbringing.	Leonardo DiCaprio	dad
My dad was in the army. World War II. He got his college education from the army. After World War II he became an insurance salesman. Really, I didn't know my dad very well. He and my mother split up after the war. I was raised by my maternal grandmother and grandfather, and by my mother.	Al Pacino	dad
My mom and dad met at Anaheim High School. After they got married, all they wanted to do was have four children, and they did.	Gwen Stefani	dad
But I honestly don't read critics. My dad reads absolutely everything ever written about me. He calls me up to read ecstatic reviews, but I always insist that I can't hear them. If you give value to the good reviews, you have to give value to the criticism.	Fiona Apple	dad
My dad spent his whole life getting into fights for telling what he believed to be the truth. Basically it comes from my dad-and he's screaming right-wing, so there you are.	Thom Yorke	dad
My dad always said he couldn't remember a time when I did not want to act.	Gwyneth Paltrow	dad
I do love a bit of fashion. I grew up around a lot of it as my mum and dad had clothing stores so my mum was always designing a lot, and I definitely had that as an influence.	Leona Lewis	dad
My dad is such a good man. You know how when you are a child you think your dad is invincible? Well, I still think that - he is so wise and everything I do I ask my dad's advice about first.	Leona Lewis	dad
I feel like I've lived quite a sheltered life, like my mom and dad were quite protective of me.	Leona Lewis	dad
My mom grew up in poverty in Oklahoma - like Dust Bowl, nine people in one room kind of place - and the way she got out of poverty was through education. My dad grew up without a dad, with very little and he also made his way out through education.	Jennifer Garner	dad
I am lucky to have had an attentive, curious and loving dad and heart-smart, down-to-earth, gifted mother. They changed the outlooks of their own lives and have never forgotten the people and organizations that helped them dream bigger than their circumstances should have allowed.	Jennifer Garner	dad
My dad and my uncles owned a bar outside of Cincinnati. I worked there growing up, mopping floors, waiting tables.	John Boehner	dad

My dad read the Bible ten times, and I want to do it in my lifetime. But it's definitely tough getting through.	Pamela Anderson	dad
I was lucky to have my dad in my life. As crazy as things got, I always had him to put his hand on my shoulder.	Sharon Stone	dad
I grew up in the world of bad television, on my dad's sets and then as a young schmuck on dating shows and so on.	George Clooney	dad
I haven't really decided to be an actor yet! I started doing plays when I was about 15 or 16. I only did it because my dad saw a bunch of pretty girls in a restaurant and he asked them where they came from and they said drama group. He said, 'Son, that is where you need to go.'	Robert Pattinson	dad
My dad says he likes to bask in my glow.	Robert Pattinson	dad
My first outdoor cooking memories are full of erratic British summers, Dad swearing at a barbecue that he couldn't put together, and eventually eating charred sausages, feeling brilliant.	Jamie Oliver	dad
In my case, I was born to parents who were very young, and I don't think they were entirely ready to have a child. My dad was going to college and working two or three jobs at the same time, and my mum was working and going to school.	Gillian Anderson	dad
I'd love to be a dad. I hope I'd be great at it. That's every man's fear, yet his most important job.	Matt Damon	dad
My parents divorced when I was young but I was brought up in two really loving households. I didn't have a contentious relationship with my mom or dad.	Matt Damon	dad
There's been times when I've had heartbreaking moments and I'm like, 'I can't believe you said that,' or 'I can't believe you did that'. And it hurts, it still hurts, and it'll always hurt, but I've never had somebody that I truly cared about just walk out on me, whether it was a boyfriend, or an aunt, mom or dad.	Shailene Woodley	dad
I grew up in a small town in Illinois, and my dad was a basketball coach. Thanks to him, I have excellent fundamentals in both basketball and baseball.	Nick Offerman	dad
I had to learn how to chop wood actually - I don't think my dad would have let me go chop wood in the backyard growing up.	Jennifer Lawrence	dad
A lot of young filmmakers bring their movies to my dad because he always gives lots of good editing ideas and notes. He'd be a good film professor.	Sofia Coppola	dad

My dad had been an actor... not only had my dad been an actor, but his dad had been an actor, and my great-grandfather had been an actor. And who knows before then?	David Hyde Pierce	dad
I went and took golf lessons so Dad would let me play with him. I was just terrible... but I was able to have a wonderful time just walking around with Dad. I can see the real pleasure of that game.	David Hyde Pierce	dad
My dad named me Dakota and my mom came up with my first name Hannah. So it's Hannah Dakota Fanning.	Dakota Fanning	dad
Real magic in relationships means an absence of judgment of others.	Wayne Dyer	dating
I'm not the girl who always has a boyfriend. I'm the girl who rarely has a boyfriend.	Taylor Swift	dating
I like the bad-boy types. Generally the guy I'm attracted to is the guy in the club with all the tattoos and nail polish. He's usually the lead singer in a punk band and plays guitar. But my serious boyfriends are relatively clean-cut, nice guys. So it's strange.	Megan Fox	dating

I used to be a real prince charming if I went on a date with a girl. But then I'd get to where I was likely to have a stroke from the stress of keeping up my act. I've since learned the key to a good date is to pay attention on her.	Matthew Perry	dating
Well, a girlfriend once told me never to fight with anybody you don't love.	Jack Nicholson	dating

Everything I buy is vintage and smells funny. Maybe that's why I don't have a boyfriend.	Lucy Liu	dating

My boyfriend calls me 'princess', but I think of myself more along the lines of 'monkey' and 'retard'.	Alicia Silverstone	dating

Rumors about me? Calista Flockhart, Pam Anderson, and Matt Damon. That's who I'm dating.	Ben Affleck	dating
I have stepped off the relationship scene to come to terms with myself. I have spent most of my adult life being 'someone's girlfriend', and now I am happy being single.	Penelope Cruz	dating
The prospect of dating someone in her twenties becomes less appealing as you get older. At some point in your fife, your tolerance level goes down and you realize that, with someone much younger, there's nothing really to talk about.	Clint Eastwood	dating
I prefer ordinary girls - you know, college students, waitresses, that sort of thing. Most of the girls I go out with are just good friends. Just because I go out to the cinema with a girl, it doesn't mean we are dating.	Leonardo DiCaprio	dating
My philosophy of dating is to just fart right away.	Jenny McCarthy	dating
I can't even explain to you how terrible that feels, that I equate dating a woman with punishment, shame, guilt, disappointment, reproach, reprimand, persecution. It's a nightmare.	John Mayer	dating

People say, 'Just say who you're dating. Then people will stop being so ravenous about it.' It's like, No they won't! They'll ask for specifics.	Kristen Stewart	dating
I wouldn't tell you anything about anybody I cared about because it becomes entertainment for other people, and it sort of just cheapens everything in your life. I would never tell you if I was dating anybody.	Kristen Stewart	dating
I'm not very experienced with boys or the whole dating thingy.	Vanessa Hudgens	dating
I'm much more interested in what an actor has to say about something substantial and important than who they're dating or what clothes they're wearing or some other asinine, insignificant aspect of their life.	Ben Affleck	dating
Dating is kind of hard. Like dinner or something like that. Like a forced awkward situation is very strange. Especially for me, for some reason.	Zac Efron	dating

Good music comes out of people playing together, knowing what they want to do and going for it. You have to sweat over it and bug it to death. You can't do it by pushing buttons and watching a TV screen.	Keith Richards	death
I look at 'Death Proof' and realize I had too much time.	Quentin Tarantino	death

Design is the fundamental soul of a man-made creation that ends up expressing itself in successive outer layers of the product or service.

Steve Jobs	design
In most people's vocabularies, design means veneer. It's interior decorating. It's the fabric of the curtains and the sofa. But to me, nothing could be further from the meaning of design.	Steve Jobs	design
The design of the Mac wasn't what it looked like, although that was part of it. Primarily, it was how it worked. To design something really well, you have to get it.

Since when has the world of computer software design been about what people want? This is a simple question of evolution. The day is quickly coming when every knee will bow down to a silicon fist, and you will all beg your binary gods for mercy.	Bill Gates	design

If you only design menus that are essentially junk or fast food, the whole infrastructure supports junk.	Jamie Oliver	design
It would be nice to design a real briefcase - you open it up and it's your computer but it also stores your books.	Steve Wozniak	design
If I designed a computer with 200 chips, I tried to design it with 150. And then I would try to design it with 100. I just tried to find every trick I could in life to design things real tiny.	Steve Wozniak	design
I actually started as a model builder and quickly progressed into production design, which made sense because I could draw and paint. But I kept watching that guy over there who was moving the actors around and setting up the shots.	James Cameron	design
Design is a word that's come to mean so much that it's also a word that has come to mean nothing.	Jonathan Ive	design

I discovered at an early age that all I've ever wanted to do is design.	Jonathan Ive	design
Perhaps I'd like to design cars, but I don't think I'd be much good at it.	Jonathan Ive	design

We all keep dreaming, and luckily, dreams come true.	Katie Holmes	dreams

I like the dreams of the future better than the history of the past.	Thomas Jefferson	dreams

The truth is, in order to get things like universal health care and a revamped education system, then someone is going to have to give up a piece of their pie so that someone else can have more.	Michelle Obama	education

You can choose a future where more Americans have the chance to gain the skills they need to compete, no matter how old they are or how much money they have. Education was the gateway to opportunity for me. It was the gateway for Michelle. And now more than ever, it is the gateway to a middle-class life.	Barack Obama	education
We can't get to the $4 trillion in savings that we need by just cutting the 12 percent of the budget that pays for things like medical research and education funding and food inspectors and the weather service. And we can't just do it by making seniors pay more for Medicare.	Barack Obama	education
Nature has always had more force than education.	Voltaire	education

The most valuable of all education is the ability to make yourself do the thing you have to do, when it has to be done, whether you like it or not.	Aldous Huxley	education
There are 4 billion cell phones in use today. Many of them are in the hands of market vendors, rickshaw drivers, and others who've historically lacked access to education and opportunity.

Only a liberal senator from Massachusetts would say that a 49 percent increase in funding for education was not enough.	George W. Bush	education
See, that's why Barack's running: to end the war in Iraq responsibly - to build an economy that lifts every family, to make sure health care is available for every American - and to make sure that every child in this nation has a world-class education all the way from preschool to college.	Michelle Obama	education
Inclusive, good-quality education is a foundation for dynamic and equitable societies.	Desmond Tutu	education
I know what it feels like to struggle to get the education that you need.	Michelle Obama	education

You can't legislate good will - that comes through education.	Malcolm X	education
My father is a real idealist, and he's all about learning. If I asked for a pair of Nikes growing up, it was just a resounding 'No.' But if I asked for a saxophone, one would appear and next day and I'd be signed up for lessons. So anything to do with education or learning, my father would spare no expense.	Hugh Jackman	education
I've never been a big believer in formal education.	Megan Fox	education

I have felt for the last 10 years I have had this battle I've been fighting so hard to have an education. It's been this uphill struggle. I was Warner Bros' pain in the butt. I was their scheduling conflict. I was the one who made life difficult.	Emma Watson	education
I recognize that I have a unique position to be a role model to young girls because I am doing something that they consider glamorous, which is acting, and yet I took a time to really get my education and study mathematics, and I think math is the cat's meow.	Danica McKellar	education
I had done quite a bit of research about math education when I spoke before Congress in 2000 about the importance of women in mathematics. The session of Congress was all about raising more scholarships for girls in college. I told them I felt that it's too late by college.	Danica McKellar	education
What I got which was unusual, especially as a child actress, was parents who believed that Hollywood was not that important. They told us education, family, health, all come first and they meant it.	Danica McKellar	education
I had never done anything with blue screen before, or prosthetics, or anything like that. Lord of the Rings was like stepping into a videogame for me. It was another world completely. But, to be honest, I basically did it so that I could have the ears. I thought they would really work with my bare head.Working with Martin Scorsese was an absolute minute-by-minute education without him ever being grandiose about it.	Cate Blanchett	education

Nancy Pelosi	education
More particularly, having a largely German-oriented education has made me very responsive to 19th-century German literature.	John le Carre	education
One of the things that's great about New York is that it is not a one-industry town. It has education, academia, the service industry, arts, publishing, theater, politics, fashion, finance, as well as movie-making.	Sarah Jessica Parker	education
My parents came from a poor background and worked their way up because of education. They saw it as a way to succeed. So they cared about me getting straight A grades when I was growing up.	Jennifer Garner	education
We all have a responsibility to volunteer somewhere and I'm lucky that I get the education and get taken to places to see what's out there and see what's happening and to then be a part of it in hopefully an impactful way.	Jennifer Garner	education
My mom was really vigorous about making sure that we saw things and that we questioned things. Education was so important to both of my parents.	Jennifer Garner	education
I feel sorry sometimes for these sportsmen and women who put in just as much effort as the footballers. For example, athletes train at least as hard as footballers but have to be happy if they can earn enough to finance a decent education.	Angela Merkel	education
The government has convinced parents that at some point it's no longer their responsibility. And in fact, they force them, in many respects, to turn their children over to the public education system and wrest control from them and block them out of participation of that. That has to change or education will not improve in this country.	Rick Santorum	education
Capitalism would have never let me be a filmmaker, living in Flint, Michigan with a high school education. I was going to have to make that happen myself.	Michael Moore	education
The value of a good education has never left me.	Michelle Pfeiffer	education
My mother is a professor of early childhood education. When I was two she would say she knew I was going to be an actor.	Matt Damon	education
The Obama administration now has regulations that tells them that they can no longer promote marriage to these young girls. They can no longer promote marriage as a way of avoiding poverty and bad choices that they make in their life. They can no longer even teach abstinence education. They have to be neutral with respect to how people behave.	Rick Santorum	education
I also found that for myself, since I've had no religious education, it was so interesting to see the different versions of heaven and what life on earth means.	Barbara Walters	education
The environment is everything that isn't me.	Albert Einstein	environmental
I think the cost of energy will come down when we make this transition to renewable energy.	Al Gore	environmental
Our world faces a true planetary emergency. I know the phrase sounds shrill, and I know it's a challenge to the moral imagination.	Al Gore	environmental
If the federal government had been around when the Creator was putting His hand to this state, Indiana wouldn't be here. It'd still be waiting for an environmental impact statement.	Ronald Reagan	environmental
I have a private plane. But I fly commercial when I go to environmental conferences.	Arnold Schwarzenegger	environmental
There are two problems for our species' survival - nuclear war and environmental catastrophe - and we're hurtling towards them. Knowingly.	Noam Chomsky	environmental
I've used the prestige and influence of having been a president of the United States as effectively as possible. And secondly, I've still been able to carry out my commitments to peace and human rights and environmental quality and freedom and democracy and so forth.	Jimmy Carter	environmental
This is absolutely bizarre that we continue to subsidize highways beyond the gasoline tax, airlines, and we don't subsidize, we don't want to subsidize a national rail system that has environmental impact.	Joe Biden	environmental
I took the initiative in moving forward a whole range of initiatives that have proven to be important to our country's economic growth, environmental protection, improvements in our educational system.	Al Gore	environmental
Raising awareness on the most pressing environmental issues of our time is more important than ever.	Leonardo DiCaprio	environmental
The industrial processes in use today were developed at a time when no one had to consider what the environmental impact was. Who cared? But making ecological concerns matter to a company's bottom line will help it do the research and development that will reinvent everything we buy.	Daniel Goleman	environmental
I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.	Martin Luther King, Jr.	equality

I believe in equality for everyone, except reporters and photographers.	Mahatma Gandhi	equality
All this talk about equality. The only thing people really have in common is that they are all going to die.	Bob Dylan	equality
In America everybody is of the opinion that he has no social superiors, since all men are equal, but he does not admit that he has no social inferiors, for, from the time of Jefferson onward, the doctrine that all men are equal applies only upwards, not downwards.	Bertrand Russell	equality
Racism is still with us. But it is up to us to prepare our children for what they have to meet, and, hopefully, we shall overcome.	Rosa Parks	equality

With patient and firm determination, I am going to press on for jobs. I'm going to press on for equality. I'm going to press on for the sake of our children. I'm going to press on for the sake of all those families who are struggling right now. I don't have time to feel sorry for myself. I don't have time to complain. I am going to press on.	Barack Obama	equality
Just as modern mass production requires the standardization of commodities, so the social process requires standardization of man, and this standardization is called equality.	Erich Fromm	equality
No advance in wealth, no softening of manners, no reform or revolution has ever brought human equality a millimeter nearer.	George Orwell	equality
You see, Africa makes a fool of our idea of justice. It makes a farce of our idea of equality. It mocks our pieties. It doubts our concern. It questions our commitment. Because there is no way we can look at what's happening in Africa, and if we're honest, conclude that it would ever be allowed to happen anywhere else.	Bono	equality
A fundamentalist can't bring himself or herself to negotiate with people who disagree with them because the negotiating process itself is an indication of implied equality.	Jimmy Carter	equality
I believe there is complete equality between men and women. And I believe those passages in the New Testament, not by Jesus, but by Paul, that say women should not adorn themselves, they should always wear hats or color their hair in church - things like that - I think they are signs of the times and should not apply to modern-day life.	Jimmy Carter	equality
For a modern woman it is important to be supported and that there is equality in every aspect, and that it's not two halves that make a whole - it's two wholes that make a whole.	Katy Perry	equality

Marriage equality is about more than just marriage. It's about something greater. It's about acceptance.	Charlize Theron	equality

Feminism is just about equality, really, and there's so much stuff attached to the word, when it's actually so simple. I don't know why it's always so bogged down.	Mia Wasikowska	equality
I believe I've always been a big believer in equality. No one has ever been able to tell me I couldn't do something because I was a girl.	Anne Hathaway	equality
Feudal societies don't create great cinema we have great theatre. The egalitarian societies create great cinema. The Americans, the French. Because equality is sort of what the cinema deals with. It deals with stories which don't fall into 'Everybody in their place and who's who,' and all that. But the theatre's full of that.	Brian Cox	equality

Experience demands that man is the only animal which devours his own kind, for I can apply no milder term to the general prey of the rich on the poor.	Thomas Jefferson	experience
Let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion. Reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle.	George Washington	experience
I don't believe people are looking for the meaning of life as much as they are looking for the experience of being alive.	Joseph Campbell	experience
If money is your hope for independence you will never have it. The only real security that a man will have in this world is a reserve of knowledge, experience, and ability.	Henry Ford	experience
Beliefs have the power to create and the power to destroy. Human beings have the awesome ability to take any experience of their lives and create a meaning that disempowers them or one that can literally save their lives.	Tony Robbins	experience
Never, never and never again shall it be that this beautiful land will again experience the oppression of one by another.	Nelson Mandela	experience

Unwearied ceaseless effort is the price that must be paid for turning faith into a rich infallible experience.	Mahatma Gandhi	experience
I am a woman in process. I'm just trying like everybody else. I try to take every conflict, every experience, and learn from it. Life is never dull.	Oprah Winfrey	experience
Experience keeps a dear school, but fools will learn in no other.	Benjamin Franklin	experience
Fame will go by and, so long, I've had you, fame. If it goes by, I've always known it was fickle. So at least it's something I experience, but that's not where I live.	Marilyn Monroe	experience
I probably hold the distinction of being one movie star who, by all laws of logic, should never have made it. At each stage of my career, I lacked the experience.	Audrey Hepburn	experience
Sex without love is a meaningless experience, but as far as meaningless experiences go its pretty damn good.	Woody Allen	experience
Experience, as a desire for experience, does not come off. We must not study ourselves while having an experience.	Friedrich Nietzsche	experience
To use the same words is not a sufficient guarantee of understanding one must use the same words for the same genus of inward experience ultimately one must have one's experiences in common.	Friedrich Nietzsche	experience
Experience has shown, and a true philosophy will always show, that a vast, perhaps the larger portion of the truth arises from the seemingly irrelevant.	Edgar Allan Poe	experience
What each must seek in his life never was on land or sea. It is something out of his own unique potentiality for experience, something that never has been and never could have been experienced by anyone else.	Joseph Campbell	experience

I don't have to have faith, I have experience.	Joseph Campbell	experience

Is there anyone so wise as to learn by the experience of others?	Voltaire	experience
Our DNA is as a consumer company - for that individual customer who's voting thumbs up or thumbs down. That's who we think about. And we think that our job is to take responsibility for the complete user experience. And if it's not up to par, it's our fault, plain and simply.	Steve Jobs	experience
I have found little that is 'good' about human beings on the whole. In my experience most of them are trash, no matter whether they publicly subscribe to this or that ethical doctrine or to none at all. That is something that you cannot say aloud, or perhaps even think.	Sigmund Freud	experience
I don't think I've ever worked so hard on something, but working on Macintosh was the neatest experience of my life. Almost everyone who worked on it will say that. None of us wanted to release it at the end. It was as though we knew that once it was out of our hands, it wouldn't be ours anymore.	Steve Jobs	experience
Take control of your consistent emotions and begin to consciously and deliberately reshape your daily experience of life.	Tony Robbins	experience

DOS is ugly and interferes with users' experience.	Bill Gates	experience
It's good to experience Hollywood in short bursts, I guess. Little snippets. I don't think I can handle being here all the time, it's pretty nutty.	Johnny Depp	experience
Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers. It may not be difficult to store up in the mind a vast quantity of facts within a comparatively short time, but the ability to form judgments requires the severe discipline of hard work and the tempering heat of experience and maturity.	Calvin Coolidge	experience
How is it possible that a being with such sensitive jewels as the eyes, such enchanted musical instruments as the ears, and such fabulous arabesque of nerves as the brain can experience itself anything less than a god.	Alan Watts	experience
Experience praises the most happy the one who made the most people happy.	Karl Marx	experience

Taste every fruit of every tree in the garden at least once. It is an insult to creation not to experience it fully. Temperance is wickedness.	Stephen Fry	experience
My own experience is use the tools that are out there. Use the digital world. But never lose sight of the need to reach out and talk to other people who don't share your view. Listen to them and see if you can find a way to compromise.	Colin Powell	experience
Screaming at children over their grades, especially to the point of the child's tears, is child abuse, pure and simple. It's not funny and it's not good parenting. It is a crushing, scarring, disastrous experience for the child. It isn't the least bit funny.	Ben Stein	experience
Every secret of a writer's soul, every experience of his life, every quality of his mind is written large in his works.	Virginia Woolf	experience

Experience has shown how deeply the seeds of war are planted by economic rivalry and social injustice.	Harry S. Truman	experience
What is the price of experience? Do men buy it for a song? Or wisdom for a dance in the street? No, it is bought with the price of all the man hath, his house, his wife, his children.	William Blake	experience
No man's knowledge here can go beyond his experience.	John Locke	experience
The reward of suffering is experience.	Harry S. Truman	experience

But perhaps the rest of us could have separate classes in science appreciation, the wonder of science, scientific ways of thinking, and the history of scientific ideas, rather than laboratory experience.	Richard Dawkins	experience
No experience is a cause of success or failure. We do not suffer from the shock of our experiences, so-called trauma - but we make out of them just what suits our purposes.	Alfred Adler	experience
You cannot, in human experience, rush into the light. You have to go through the twilight into the broadening day before the noon comes and the full sun is upon the landscape.	Woodrow Wilson	experience
I don't claim to be knowledgeable about theology. Most of my knowledge comes out of my experience and the lessons in the Bible. Every Sunday I'm home I teach 45 minutes and we boiled them down to one page for the new book, 'Through the Year with Jimmy Carter.'	Jimmy Carter	experience
Masterpieces are not single and solitary births they are the outcome of many years of thinking in common, of thinking by the body of the people, so that the experience of the mass is behind the single voice.	Virginia Woolf	experience

To 'choose' dogma and faith over doubt and experience is to throw out the ripening vintage and to reach greedily for the Kool-Aid.	Christopher Hitchens	experience
I maybe had a first love and had my heart broken, but reflecting on it, I don't think that was love. I think as I'm getting older and having more in-depth relationships, maybe I'll experience it. At the moment, I don't know, exactly, if I've been in love.	Selena Gomez	experience
Yes, I've been trepanned. That's quite an interesting experience, especially for my brain surgeon, who saw my thoughts flying around in my brain.	Keith Richards	experience

The dictum that truth always triumphs over persecution is one of the pleasant falsehoods which men repeat after one another till they pass into commonplaces, but which all experience refutes.	John Stuart Mill	experience
It would be my guess that Madonna is not a very happy woman. From my own experience, having gone through persona changes like that, that kind of clawing need to be the center of attention is not a pleasant place to be.	David Bowie	experience
Imagine a judicial nominee said 'my experience as a white man makes me better than a Latina woman.' Wouldn't they have to withdraw? New racism is no better than old racism.	Newt Gingrich	experience
The experience of life consists of the experience which the spirit has of itself in matter and as matter, in mind and as mind, in emotion, as emotion, etc.	Franz Kafka	experience

Talking with you is sort of the conversational equivalent of an out of body experience.	Bill Watterson	experience
If you do build a great experience, customers tell each other about that. Word of mouth is very powerful.	Jeff Bezos	experience

The experience of democracy is like the experience of life itself-always changing, infinite in its variety, sometimes turbulent and all the more valuable for having been tested by adversity.	Jimmy Carter	experience
Sure, I suffered a lot. But it's not like the end of the world and it's not who I am. I lead quite a pleasant life and I'm able to divorce a perceived reality from my actual experience of life.	Ben Affleck	experience
Parents of recovered children, and I've met hundreds, all share the same experience of doubters and deniers telling us our child must have never even had autism or that the recovery was simply nature's course.

I don't care how smart a kid you are. The only way you learn what's not right is from experience.	Cameron Diaz	experience
Poets are the only people to whom love is not only a crucial, but an indispensable experience, which entitles them to mistake it for a universal one.	Hannah Arendt	experience
The amount of meetings I've been in - people would be shocked. But that's how you gain experience, how you can gain knowledge, being in meetings and participating. You learn and grow.	Tiger Woods	experience
I would love to work in America. I wouldn't love to live there, but I'd love to experience working there.	Daniel Radcliffe	experience
I had one relative who passed away but fortunately none others. So my sort of experience of it is quite limited, thankfully.	Daniel Radcliffe	experience
As the leader of twelve apostles, even Jesus had more executive experience than Obama.	Ann Coulter	experience
If we didn't want to upset anyone, we would make films about sewing, but even that could be dangerous. But I think finally, in a film, it is how the balance is and the feelings are.

I would wish for any one of my colleagues to have the experience of working with Martin Scorsese once in their lifetime.	Daniel Day-Lewis	experience

I had the experience last year of directing my first feature while I had a 1-year-old son and while I was also pregnant, so I am now well aware of the difficulties women who are rearing children face when they're also trying to make headway in mainstream of film.	Diablo Cody	experience
You know, it shouldn't just be about women as heroic figures overcoming things, it just needs to be about women in general getting the opportunity to play a multitude of roles, telling a multitude of stories - just to express human experience from a woman's perspective. I hope, someday, we can get to that point. I'm all about representation.	Diablo Cody	experience
There's probably no experience more alienating than fame, other than a terminal illness, where you actually find yourself in a situation that nobody around you can relate to.	Diablo Cody	experience
One nice thing about being a woman in Hollywood is that the women tend to be very close-knit. All of us writers and directors know each other and cling to each other for safety and support, and it's really a completely different vibe than the men experience out here, where they're all trying to murder each other.	Diablo Cody	experience
So I've seen life as one long learning process. And if I see - you know, if I fly on somebody else's airline and find the experience is not a pleasant one, which it wasn't in - 21 years ago, then I'd think, well, you know, maybe I can create the kind of airline that I'd like to fly on.	Richard Branson	experience
I just think that the collective experience of going to see a film is something you can't recreate.	Daniel Craig	experience
I discovered early on that some performers live their life in order to act, so all their relationships are simply an experience that they can feed back into their work. Which I find vampiric.	Cate Blanchett	experience
If you've got a piece and you can feel the person who's going to direct it is really made for it, if it's really special for them, then it's going to be a better-than-usual experience.	Edward Norton	experience
Obviously an actor draws on his own experience.	Christopher Walken	experience
I really do love Diana Ross I grew up listening to her records. I grew up in a little town in Mexico, so while we got the music, we never got the experience of watching her.	Salma Hayek	experience
The monsters of our childhood do not fade away, neither are they ever wholly monstrous. But neither, in my experience, do we ever reach a plane of detachment regarding our parents, however wise and old we may become. To pretend otherwise is to cheat.	John le Carre	experience
A spy, like a writer, lives outside the mainstream population. He steals his experience through bribes and reconstructs it.	John le Carre	experience
We see our customers as invited guests to a party, and we are the hosts. It's our job every day to make every important aspect of the customer experience a little bit better.	Jeff Bezos	experience
Prudence is but experience, which equal time, equally bestows on all men, in those things they equally apply themselves unto.	Thomas Hobbes	experience
When you go to the movies with your whole family, it's a different experience. For some reason, it's something that you're all doing together and you take away something special in that.	Vin Diesel	experience
All of the legal defense funds out there, they're looking for people out there with court of appeals experience, because court of appeals is where policy is made. And I know, I know this is on tape and I should never say that because we don't make law, I know. I know.	Sonia Sotomayor	experience
I have relationships with people I'm working with, based on our combined interest. It doesn't make the relationship any less sincere, but it does give it a focus that may not last beyond the experience.	Harrison Ford	experience
Every day is a new experience and I take it as it comes.	Zac Efron	experience
I'm not particularly precious about the theatrical experience any more.	Edward Norton	experience
A lot of why I do something is just the novelty of the experience.	Edward Norton	experience
You can live your whole life in your brain and not experience what's around you. You go crazy that way.	Fiona Apple	experience
I wouldn't say I'm a very original thinker, but if I have a good experience with something, I'll want to take it further or adapt it in some way.	Gwyneth Paltrow	experience
I was quite able at the insignificant work I did in MI6, but absolutely dysfunctional in my domestic life. I had no experience of fatherhood. I had no example of marital bliss or the family unit.	John le Carre	experience
I learn from experience.	Alan Dershowitz	experience
I have the ordinary experience of being anonymous when I'm in an airplane talking to air-traffic control, and they don't know who they're talking to. I have a lot of common experiences.	Harrison Ford	experience
I definitely feel more complete than before. There's a void you have when you don't feel you've found the other part of who you are, so I'm in a different place now and that's nice to experience.	Mariah Carey	experience
While I was trying to save money to go to the National Institute of Dramatic Art in Australia I ended up getting all of this experience which meant that by the time I had enough money in the bank to go to school I didn't really need to go to school anymore.	Russell Crowe	experience
I think experience will teach you a combination of liberalism and conservatism. We have to be progressive and at the same time we have to retain values. We have to hold onto the past as we explore the future.	Oliver Stone	experience
I would vote for the man who's lived life, who's done different occupations, who's been out in the real world and struggled to make a living, struggled to raise a family, struggled with life as it exists. So I'd vote for experience, honest experience.	Oliver Stone	experience
There are more people than you think who want to have a challenging experience, in which they are obliged to reflect about the past.	Umberto Eco	experience
I think that the mark of a great book is that it will meet you wherever you're at and you'll feel and experience something new and different each time you read it.	Josh Radnor	experience
Well, I stopped drinking. That was actually a big deal. I didn't go through any harrowing rock-bottom experience. I just made a decision to stop drinking.	Josh Radnor	experience
I think most artists will experience a lot of negative people on Twitter but, thank God, I've got so many followers that I'm not able to see them that much. I'll see some from time to time but, for the most part, I always focus on something good.	Nicki Minaj	experience
I've had a great experience with pretty much everybody I've worked with.	Mia Wasikowska	experience

But I just know from experience that accent wise, even if you're an accent genius, crossing the Atlantic is the hardest thing in the world either way.	Hugh Grant	experience
On the one hand, we'll never experience childbirth. On the other hand, we can open all our own jars.	Bruce Willis	experience
My advice would be to write what is most personal and specific to your experience or your life. And your voice will emerge and because of its specificity, it will be universal.	David Schwimmer	experience
I will perform My Heart Will Go On for the rest of my life and it will always remain a very emotional experience for me.	Celine Dion	experience
I love music, and after my first experience with movies, I can't wait to do more.	Rihanna	experience

Socialism is a philosophy of failure, the creed of ignorance, and the gospel of envy, its inherent virtue is the equal sharing of misery.	Winston Churchill	failure
Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.	Winston Churchill	failure
Develop success from failures. Discouragement and failure are two of the surest stepping stones to success.	Dale Carnegie	failure
Failure is simply the opportunity to begin again, this time more intelligently.	Henry Ford	failure
Leadership is solving problems. The day soldiers stop bringing you their problems is the day you have stopped leading them. They have either lost confidence that you can help or concluded you do not care. Either case is a failure of leadership.	Colin Powell	failure
The fact that we are here today to debate raising America's debt limit is a sign of leadership failure. America has a debt problem and a failure of leadership. Americans deserve better. I, therefore, intend to oppose the effort to increase America's debt.	Barack Obama	failure
Think like a queen. A queen is not afraid to fail. Failure is another steppingstone to greatness.	Oprah Winfrey	failure
In America, there's a failure to appreciate Europe's leading role in the world.	Barack Obama	failure
The Bush Administration's failure to be consistently involved in helping Israel achieve peace with the Palestinians has been both wrong for our friendship with Israel, as well as badly damaging to our standing in the Arab world.	Barack Obama	failure

Without failure there is no sweetness in success. There's no understanding of it.	Glenn Beck	failure
I mean, I love L.A. - I love living here. But I wish that we could make things without the need to hit a home run every single time. It's a unique thing to Hollywood that if you don't do that every time, then you're considered a failure. But it's like, 'Well, are you making movies to be successful? Or are you making movies to learn something?'	Kristen Stewart	failure
I mean, I love L.A. - I love living here. But I wish that we could make things without the need to hit a home run every single time. It's a unique thing to Hollywood that if you don't do that every time, then you're considered a failure.	Kristen Stewart	failure

Faith... must be enforced by reason... when faith becomes blind it dies.	Mahatma Gandhi	faith
My family, frankly, they weren't folks who went to church every week. My mother was one of the most spiritual people I knew but she didn't raise me in the church, so I came to my Christian faith later in life and it was because the precepts of Jesus Christ spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that I would want to lead.	Barack Obama	faith
Faith, there hath been many great men that have flattered the people who ne'er loved them.	William Shakespeare	faith

Faith is the great cop-out, the great excuse to evade the need to think and evaluate evidence. Faith is belief in spite of, even perhaps because of, the lack of evidence.	Richard Dawkins	faith
To have faith is to trust yourself to the water. When you swim you don't grab hold of the water, because if you do you will sink and drown. Instead you relax, and float.	Alan Watts	faith
Anyone who is to find Christ must first find the church. How could anyone know where Christ is and what faith is in him unless he knew where his believers are?	Martin Luther	faith
Christianity is not the faith of the complacent, the comfortable or of the timid. It demands and creates heroic souls like Wesley, Wilberforce, Bonhoeffer, John Paul the Second, and Billy Graham. Each showed, in their own way, the relentless and powerful influence of the message of Jesus Christ.	Mitt Romney	faith
It's not the tools that you have faith in - tools are just tools. They work, or they don't work. It's people you have faith in or not. Yeah, sure, I'm still optimistic I mean, I get pessimistic sometimes but not for long.	Steve Jobs	faith
Faith must trample under foot all reason, sense, and understanding.	Martin Luther	faith
It's not a faith in technology. It's faith in people.	Steve Jobs	faith
To insure the adoration of a theorem for any length of time, faith is not enough, a police force is needed as well.	Albert Camus	faith

You know, my faith is one that admits some doubt.	Barack Obama	faith
What I think is fair to say is that, coming out of the Republican camp, there have been efforts to suggest that perhaps I'm not who I say I am when it comes to my faith - something which I find deeply offensive, and that has been going on for a pretty long time.	Barack Obama	faith
If he have faith, the believer cannot be restrained. He betrays himself. He breaks out. He confesses and teaches this gospel to the people at the risk of life itself.	Martin Luther	faith
Faith is permitting ourselves to be seized by the things we do not see.	Martin Luther	faith
Reason is the enemy of faith.	Martin Luther	faith
It strikes me as odd that the free exercise of religious faith is sometimes treated as a problem, something America is stuck with instead of blessed with.	Mitt Romney	faith
Only the person who has faith in himself is able to be faithful to others.	Erich Fromm	faith
The meme for blind faith secures its own perpetuation by the simple unconscious expedient of discouraging rational inquiry.	Richard Dawkins	faith
No person I have ever met, not even the most righteous or pure of heart, has gone without those times when faith recedes in the busy-ness of life.	Mitt Romney	faith

There is nothing wrong with America that faith, love of freedom, intelligence, and energy of her citizens cannot cure.	Dwight D. Eisenhower	faith
If children understand that beliefs should be substantiated with evidence, as opposed to tradition, authority, revelation or faith, they will automatically work out for themselves that they are atheists.	Richard Dawkins	faith
In other words, a person who is fanatic in matters of religion, and clings to certain ideas about the nature of God and the universe, becomes a person who has no faith at all.	Alan Watts	faith
No lover, if he be of good faith, and sincere, will deny he would prefer to see his mistress dead than unfaithful.	Marquis de Sade	faith

Only our individual faith in freedom can keep us free.	Dwight D. Eisenhower	faith
A better world shall emerge based on faith and understanding.	Douglas MacArthur	faith
Faith is a state of openness or trust.	Alan Watts	faith
Do I think faith will be an important part of being a good president? Yes, I do.	George W. Bush	faith
Faith is part of who I am, yes. I was raised Christian Scientist. The most important thing I saw every single week on the wall at Sunday school was the Golden Rule.	Ellen DeGeneres	faith
Faith is not believing that God can. It is knowing that God will.	Ben Stein	faith

I never really had the classic struggle. I had faith.	Denzel Washington	faith
If I advocate cautious optimism it is not because I do not have faith in the future but because I do not want to encourage blind faith.	Aung San Suu Kyi	faith
Religion is part of the human make-up. It's also part of our cultural and intellectual history. Religion was our first attempt at literature, the texts, our first attempt at cosmology, making sense of where we are in the universe, our first attempt at health care, believing in faith healing, our first attempt at philosophy.	Christopher Hitchens	faith
Our society is illuminated by the spiritual insights of the Hebrew prophets. America and Israel have a common love of human freedom, and they have a common faith in a democratic way of life.	Lyndon B. Johnson	faith
The separation of church and state is a source of strength, but the conscience of our nation does not call for separation between men of state and faith in the Supreme Being.	Lyndon B. Johnson	faith
It's very important that every movie I do makes money because I want the people that had the faith in me to get their money back.	Quentin Tarantino	faith
Let judges secretly despair of justice: their verdicts will be more acute. Let generals secretly despair of triumph killing will be defamed. Let priests secretly despair of faith: their compassion will be true.	Leonard Cohen	faith
I don't think that the total creation took place in six days as we now measure time. If we can confirm, say, the Big Bang theory, that doesn't at all cause me to question my faith that God created the Big Bang.	Jimmy Carter	faith
Trust is not the same as faith. A friend is someone you trust. Putting faith in anyone is a mistake.	Christopher Hitchens	faith
There's been some research in cognitive science, I'm told, that discloses that there have always been perhaps 10 to 15 percent of people who are, as Pascal puts it, so made that they cannot believe. To us, when people talk about faith, it's white noise.	Christopher Hitchens	faith
Base souls have no faith in great individuals.	Jean-Jacques Rousseau	faith
Between understanding and faith immediate connections must subsist.	Marquis de Sade	faith
I think there ought to be a strict separation or wall built between our religious faith and our practice of political authority in office.

My faith helps me understand that circumstances don't dictate my happiness, my inner peace.	Denzel Washington	faith
Faith Hill is a big role model.	Taylor Swift	faith
You just have to have a simple faith.	Jimmy Carter	faith
In religious and in secular affairs, the more fervent beliefs attract followers. If you are a moderate in any respect - if you're a moderate on abortion, if you're a moderate on gun control, or if you're a moderate in your religious faith - it doesn't evolve into a crusade where you're either right or wrong, good or bad, with us or against us.	Jimmy Carter	faith
I don't know if the average person really has faith in Washington anymore.	Tori Amos	faith
I've always thought that as long as directors and casting directors don't see me as just Harry Potter, I'll be OK. People have shown a lot of faith in me, and I owe them a huge debt. They're letting me prove that I'm serious about this.	Daniel Radcliffe	faith
I have always been the kid who's asked 'Why?' In my faith, you're just supposed to have faith. But I was always like 'why?'	Katy Perry	faith
The Christian faith can never be separated from the soil of sacred events, from the choice made by God, who wanted to speak to us, to become man, to die and rise again, in a particular place and at a particular time.	Joseph Ratzinger	faith
Let me go over this again on the reclaiming the civil rights movement. People of faith that believe that you have an equal right to justice - that is the essence. And if it's not the essence, then we've been sold a pack of lies. The essence is everyone deserves a shot - the content of character, not the color of skin.	Glenn Beck	faith
But I don't necessarily define my faith by going to church every Sunday.	Miley Cyrus	faith
I just sort of take it from a character perspective, and I don't know if he was necessarily spiritual, but I do think he had hope. He was a character that was comfortable having hope in his life, and hope is faith.	Ryan Gosling	faith
My gut feeling about sequels is that they should be premeditated: You should try to write a trilogy first or at least sketch out a trilogy if you have any faith in your film.	Vin Diesel	faith
My faith foundation works to bring about a greater respect and understanding between different faiths. We basically work with six popular religions in the world which are the three Abrahamic religions, Hinduism and Buddhism and Sikhism.	Tony Blair	faith
Laughter kills fear, and without fear there can be no faith. For without fear of the devil there is no need for God.	Sean Connery	faith

The abuse of faith has to be resisted precisely.	Joseph Ratzinger	faith
Earmarks have become a symbol of a Congress that has broken faith with the people. This earmark ban shows the American people we are listening and we are dead serious about ending business as usual in Washington.	John Boehner	faith
President Obama and his radical feminist enforcers have had it in for Catholic medical providers from the get-go. It's about time all people of faith fought back against this unprecedented encroachment on religious liberty. First, they came for the Catholics. Who's next?	Michelle Malkin	faith
I think the Moslem faith teaches hate.	Jerry Falwell	faith
I have faith in the jury system.	Nancy Grace	faith

America cannot continue to lead the family of nations around the world if we suffer the collapse of the family here at home.	Mitt Romney	family
First and foremost comes my family and my life with Brad. We have so much joy in raising our children and teaching them about the world that nothing really compares to that.	Angelina Jolie	family
When you have a godly husband, a godly wife, children who respect their parents and who are loved by their parents, who provide for those children their physical and spiritual and material needs, lovingly, you have the ideal unit.	Jerry Falwell	family
What must it be like for a little boy to read that daddy never loved mummy?	Princess Diana	family
My kids give me the balance to live right.	Celine Dion	family
There is no such thing as fun for the whole family.	Jerry Seinfeld	family
I have frequently been questioned, especially by women, of how I could reconcile family life with a scientific career. Well, it has not been easy.	Marie Curie	family

At a certain point I'm going to want to have a family.	Gwen Stefani	family
We'll sort of get over the marriage first and then maybe look at the kids. But obviously we want a family so we'll have to start thinking about that.	Prince William	family
I love children and I get along with them great. It's just that I believe if you're going to be a parent, there has to be something inside you that says, 'I want a family.' I don't feel that sense of urgency.	George Clooney	family
I don't know if I believe in marriage. I believe in family, love and children.	Penelope Cruz	family
It was the labor movement that helped secure so much of what we take for granted today. The 40-hour work week, the minimum wage, family leave, health insurance, Social Security, Medicare, retirement plans. The cornerstones of the middle-class security all bear the union label.	Barack Obama	family
Fathers should be neither seen nor heard. That is the only proper basis for family life.	Oscar Wilde	family
He that raises a large family does, indeed, while he lives to observe them, stand a broader mark for sorrow but then he stands a broader mark for pleasure too.	Benjamin Franklin	family
The other night I ate at a real nice family restaurant. Every table had an argument going.	George Carlin	family
I can make a firm pledge, under my plan, no family making less than $250,000 a year will see any form of tax increase. Not your income tax, not your payroll tax, not your capital gains taxes, not any of your taxes.	Barack Obama	family
The details surrounding both my marriage and subsequent filing for divorce are private, and I had hoped to keep them that way for the sake of my family.	Eminem	family
All the laws and legislation in the world will never heal this world like the loving hearts and arms of mothers and fathers. If every child could drift to sleep feeling wrapped in the love of their family - and God's love - this world would be a far more gentle and better place.	Mitt Romney	family
But let me perfectly clear, because I know you'll hear the same old claims that rolling back these tax breaks means a massive tax increase on the American people: if your family earns less than $250,000 a year, you will not see your taxes increased a single dime. I repeat: not one single dime.	Barack Obama	family
I am confident that nobody... will accuse me of selfishness if I ask to spend time, while I am still in good health, with my family, my friends and also with myself.	Nelson Mandela	family
In the richest country in the history of the world, this Obama economy has crushed the middle class. Family income has fallen by $4,000, but health insurance premiums are higher, food prices are higher, utility bills are higher, and gasoline prices have doubled. Today more Americans wake up in poverty than ever before.	Mitt Romney	family
We believed in our idea - a family park where parents and children could have fun- together.	Walt Disney	family
I have Muslim members of my family. I have lived in Muslim countries.	Barack Obama	family

My mother's love has always been a sustaining force for our family, and one of my greatest joys is seeing her integrity, her compassion, her intelligence reflected in my daughters.	Michelle Obama	family
Now is the moment when we can stand up and say, 'I'm an American. I make my destiny. And we deserve better! My children deserve better! My family deserves better. My country deserves better!' So here we stand. Americans have a choice.	Mitt Romney	family
The promise of America has always been that if you worked hard, had the right values, took some risks, that there was an opportunity to build a better life for your family and for your next generation.	Mitt Romney	family
President Obama promised to begin to slow the rise of the oceans and heal the planet. My promise... is to help you and your family.	Mitt Romney	family
You cannot have maternal health without reproductive health. And reproductive health includes contraception and family planning and access to legal, safe abortion.	Hillary Clinton	family
A family with the wrong members in control that, perhaps, is as near as one can come to describing England in a phrase.	George Orwell	family
Where would you be without friends? The people to pick you up when you need lifting? We come from homes far from perfect, so you end up almost parent and sibling to your friends - your own chosen family. There's nothing like a really loyal, dependable, good friend. Nothing.	Jennifer Aniston	family
In my family, we were Americans, we were Republicans and we were Methodists.	Hillary Clinton	family
I believe with all my heart that America remains 'the great idea' that inspires the world. It is a privilege to be born here. It is an honor to become a citizen here. It is a gift to raise your family here, to vote here, and to live here.	Arnold Schwarzenegger	family
My work and my family are very important to me.	Stephen Hawking	family
Everything I have, my career, my success, my family, I owe to America.	Arnold Schwarzenegger	family
It's hard knowing who to trust with your personal life. When you cry in your room at night, you don't always know who to call. So I am very close to my family.	Lady Gaga	family
Think about what people are doing on Facebook today. They're keeping up with their friends and family, but they're also building an image and identity for themselves, which in a sense is their brand. They're connecting with the audience that they want to connect to. It's almost a disadvantage if you're not on it now.	Mark Zuckerberg	family
I had this child, and it destroyed my family.	Arnold Schwarzenegger	family
The God who existed before any religion counts on you to make the oneness of the human family known and celebrated.	Desmond Tutu	family

God's dream is that you and I and all of us will realize that we are family, that we are made for togetherness, for goodness, and for compassion.	Desmond Tutu	family
In the investigation of a neurotic style of life, we must always suspect an opponent, and note who suffers most because of the patient's condition. Usually this is a member of the family.	Alfred Adler	family
I cannot remember a moment in my life when I have not felt the love of my family. We were a family that would have killed for each other - and we still are.	Richard Branson	family
In God's family, there are no outsiders, no enemies.	Desmond Tutu	family
Everything family does is reflection on the other people.	Kim Kardashian	family
My mother has always been the social glue holding the family together.	Kim Kardashian	family
I always put clothes and family photos under the mattress, in case the house burns down.	Kim Kardashian	family
We will see a breakdown of the family and family values if we decide to approve same-sex marriage, and if we decide to establish homosexuality as an acceptable alternative lifestyle with all the benefits that go with equating it with the heterosexual lifestyle.	Jerry Falwell	family
Leave the matter of religion to the family altar, the church, and the private school, supported entirely by private contributions. Keep the church and state forever separate.	Ulysses S. Grant	family
I've made all my money on my own without my family and I work very hard.	Paris Hilton	family
I guess you could say I devoted myself so strongly to my music that for awhile I forgot about my family. But I only get one set of parents, and I think I forgot about that for a little while.	Lady Gaga	family
It all starts with the script: it's not worth taking myself away from my family if I don't have something I'm really passionate about.	Steven Spielberg	family
There's a schizoid streak within the family anyway so I dare say that I'm affected by that. The majority of the people in my family have been in some kind of mental institution, as for my brother he doesn't want to leave. He likes it very much.	David Bowie	family
Let your family, staff, and friends know that you're still the same person, despite all the publicity and notoriety that accompanies your position.	Donald Rumsfeld	family
I realised how paranoid and guarded and not trusting - walled-in - I had become. Not consciously so, but just this armour that I kind of have, protective armour. It's not for my friends or family, but for being.outside in the world, always on guard.	Jennifer Aniston	family
Together, we can help make sure that every family that walks into a restaurant can make an easy, healthy choice.	Michelle Obama	family
And when I was young, my family was perfectly nice. I write a lot about it, as you noticed. But it was rather limited. I think, I don't think anyone in my family would really feel I'd done them an injustice by saying that. We didn't see many people. There were many books. It was as if I wanted to get away from home.	Christopher Hitchens	family
I just want my family to be safe. Because I am sometimes polarizing, I fear for their safety.	Lady Gaga	family
In five years' time I'd like to be a mum. I want to settle down and have a family, definitely sooner rather than later. I'd like to have finished my second album too, maybe even my third. I'd like a sound that sticks around that other people are inspired by and that people know is me.	Adele	family
The only people that you really have, that I learned, are your family, because they love you no matter what.	Miley Cyrus	family
Protecting the institution of marriage safeguards, I believe, the American family.	John Boehner	family
I know I'm talented, but I wasn't put here to sing. I was put here to be a wife and a mom and look after my family. I love what I do, but it's not where it begins and ends.	Amy Winehouse	family
I came from a poor family, so working and going to school at the same time was natural. It taught me multi-tasking, although we didn't call it that back then. I learned I could never be idle, I need to be doing many things at once.	Alan Dershowitz	family
When you look at Prince Charles, don't you think that someone in the Royal family knew someone in the Royal family?	Robin Williams	family
I don't see how the party that says it's the party of the family is going to adopt an immigration policy which destroys families that have been here a quarter century.	Newt Gingrich	family
Being a Barrymore didn't help me, other than giving me a great sense of pride and a strange spiritual sense that I felt OK about having the passion to act. It made sense because my whole family had done it and it helped rationalise it for me.	Drew Barrymore	family
I grew up in a family that was multifaceted, sexually oriented, and pretty much open to everything. And because I was working, my friends were all adults. I had a tough time going to different schools because people knew me from films and I was the fat child who got beaten up every day.	Drew Barrymore	family
I really have created a family. I work with the people I love, I travel with them, I make films with them, and I'm in an office with them. So in a weird way - I know I haven't birthed a child - I feel that I'm a part of creating a family. It's a tribe. I love that word.	Drew Barrymore	family
When I did 'E.T.,' it sort of solidified the only family I know are these film crews. These gypsies. These filmmakers. That was the solidification and the clicking revelations of 'This is what I want to do with my life and this is where I'm going to survive.'	Drew Barrymore	family
As a child, the family that I had and the love I had from my two parents allowed me to go ahead and be more aggressive, to search and to take risks knowing that, if I failed, I could always come home to a family of love and support.	Tiger Woods	family
I have let my family down and I regret those transgressions with all of my heart.	Tiger Woods	family

I come from a very non-accepting family, but I'm very accepting.	Katy Perry	family
When you live in an alcoholic family or an abusive family, you tiptoe, you don't want to step on any mines.	Glenn Beck	family
My parents were drawn to the idea that there was space and opportunity in Australia. For the meagre sum of &pound10, you could sail your entire family out to Australia, so that's what my father chose to do.	Hugh Jackman	family
Personal sins should not require press releases and problems within a family shouldn't have to mean public confessions.	Tiger Woods	family
I have not been true to my values and the behavior my family deserves.	Tiger Woods	family
I hurt my wife, my kids, my mother, my wife's family, my friends, my foundation and kids all around the world who admired me.	Tiger Woods	family
My ultimate life dream project is my kids. My family.	Denzel Washington	family
I can't tell you how scary it can be walking onto a movie and suddenly joining this family, it's like going to somebody else's Christmas dinner, everyone knows everyone, and you're there and you're not quite sure what you're supposed to be doing.	John Cleese	family
I'm a strong person, I'm a strong family man, I'm a strong husband and a strong father.	David Beckham	family
My mom has made it possible for me to be who I am. Our family is everything. Her greatest skill was encouraging me to find my own person and own independence.	Charlize Theron	family
Acting is just a way of making a living, the family is life.	Denzel Washington	family
Santa Barbara is my hood. I mean, it's not much of a hood, but it is definitely like my hood. I claim Santa Barbara like I claim my family. I'm going to be married and buried there.	Katy Perry	family
I hate the way they portray us in the media. If you see a black family it says they're looting, if you see a white family it says they're looking for food.	Kanye West	family
I do not see my family life in any way, shape, or form as an opportunity for a photo.	Shania Twain	family
Stay out of the sun, because it is the worst thing in terms of aging. I'm very medical. I come from a medical family.	Nicole Kidman	family
If you don't have public hangings for bad culture in a company, if you don't take people out and let them say, they went home to spend more time with the family. It's crazy.	Jack Welch	family
Young actors often don't think of the consequences of doing nudity or sex scenes. They want the role so badly that they agree to be exploited, and then end up embarrassing family, friends, and even strangers.	Natalie Portman	family
You don't have to give birth to someone to have a family.	Sandra Bullock	family
By the time I was 30, nobody would work with me. I was friendless, I was hopeless, I was suicidal, lost my family - I mean, it was bad. Bottomed out, didn't know what I was going to do. I actually thought I was going to be a chef - go to work in a kitchen someplace.	Glenn Beck	family
If you see a black family, it's looting, but if it's a white family they are looking for food.	Kanye West	family
I'm not ready to get married, but I have a pretty great family and I'd like that too, someday.	Kristen Stewart	family
I have a great family by the way, but you need to find people who can pull something out from you that might be otherwise unseen.	Kristen Stewart	family
A family is very special. So when a family splits up, it's not good, it's never good.	Aung San Suu Kyi	family
I grew up in a family of strong women and I owe any capacity I have to understand women to my mother and big sister. They taught me to respect women in a way where I've always felt a strong emotional connection to women, which has also helped me in the way I approach my work as an actor.	Ryan Gosling	family
My priorities are always going to be my husband and my family now. That's a huge, huge thing.	Gwen Stefani	family
There's no road map on how to raise a family: it's always an enormous negotiation.	Meryl Streep	family
My family is my life, and I'll never lose that.	Jessica Simpson	family
I guess now that I think back, I used to play priest and be a funny priest. I don't know, I grew up in such a Catholic family that I kind of liked to test the boundaries a little bit and I think I had fun watching my mom laugh.	Jenny McCarthy	family
I do all of the grocery shopping in my little family. I buy cheese, of many different kinds, sliced packaged meats and poultry, bagels, immense quantities of eggs, pre-made fried chicken. Milk. Bacon. It is insane how much dairy, deli and bakery stuff I buy.	Ben Stein	family
I have a mother that's very strong and family that surround me and constantly tell me they love me.	Whitney Houston	family
I'm happiest with my family around me.	Amy Winehouse	family

I have one friend that I've had since I was born, and she's from Coatzacoalcos. She's not really impressed or interested in the actor's life. My family isn't really either.	Salma Hayek	family
I'm an actor I'm not a politician. I always kick myself when I talk too much about family, or personal things.	Christian Bale	family
I was the oldest of the children in my family. I had to do a lot of diaper-changing and lunch-making. I was taking my little sister to ballet, picking up my brother, sort of being a super-nanny.	Vin Diesel	family
I'm thinking of a legacy that I can be proud of and wealth that my grandchildren can use to go to college. So world domination - in terms of providing for my family - is absolutely my goal.	Nicki Minaj	family
My rule is, whatever you were calling me four years ago is what you should be calling me now, because I don't like it when my family or close friends call me Nicki Minaj. To me I'm not Nicki Minaj when I'm with them.	Nicki Minaj	family
I always wanted to be a farmer. There is a tradition of that in my family.	Bjork	family
Anyone that has a job that takes them away from home, I think, can understand the difficulties in maintaining consistency, not only with your family and those you love but with your friends.	Heath Ledger	family
God created the family to provide the maximum love and support and morality and example that one can imagine.	Jerry Falwell	family
It's a family that's loaded with grudges and passion. We come from a long line of robbers and highwaymen in Italy, you know. Killers, even.	Nicolas Cage	family
Of course I regret not having been able to spend time with my family.	Aung San Suu Kyi	family
One wants to be together with one's family. That's what families are about.	Aung San Suu Kyi	family
Some of the things you read you get an immediate reaction to so I've stopped reading things now. I do worry about my family though. Some people do try some nasty things to get at them and try and get a reaction from them.	Russell Crowe	family
Anybody who is running a marathon or doing a walkathon, doing a fundraiser for their school, their company, by far it's guaranteed the easiest and most fun way to quickly set up a fundraising campaign and send it around to your friends and family.	Edward Norton	family
I went through a period of great rebellion within my family, when I was about 9 or 10. I was mad, I had no focus, had no real interest in anything, and so I started to do things that were just rebellious and stupid.	Kevin Spacey	family
My mom always said I was the peacemaker in the family. My older brother, Eric, was the leader, the creative one. I was just his puppet.	Gwen Stefani	family
Finding that balance between work and family is the hardest thing I've ever done - by far.	Gwen Stefani	family
When I heard the royal family wanted to have me perform in celebration of Prince William's marriage, I knew I had to give them a little something. 'Wet' is the perfect anthem for Prince William or any playa to get the club smokin'.	Snoop Dogg	family
Touring is tough. You're almost in a haze because you don't really know where you are half the time: You're in a hotel room one moment, and the next thing you know, you're onstage performing for 60,000 people, then you're back on an airplane. It's very hectic and I couldn't do it without my family.	Vanessa Hudgens	family
My mother isolated herself from all family and friends for some 20 years. And never met her grandchild, my son.	Laura Schlessinger	family
I love seeing my family.	Mia Wasikowska	family
I love film. After a yummy meal for the whole family and some truly great friends, we often go out to see something beautiful and unique.	Gwyneth Paltrow	family
You have no idea how humiliating it was, as a boy, to suddenly have all your clothes, your toys, snatched by the bailiff. I mean we were a middle-class family, it's not as if it was happening up and down the street. It made me ashamed, I felt dirty.	John le Carre	family
I'm very, very concerned about the Bush presidency. I'm worried about the kinds of cuts in domestic programs that mean something to a lot of people, including members of my family, who depend on certain things from the government.	Sarah Jessica Parker	family
I have a lot of responsibilities outside myself. I have a large family. I want to know I can always be helpful.	Sarah Jessica Parker	family
I've always known I wanted a family.	Charlize Theron	family

I have no use for people who throw their weight around as celebrities, or for those who fawn over you just because you are famous.	Walt Disney	famous
What a heavy burden is a name that has become too famous.	Voltaire	famous
I just want to make music, I don't want people to talk about me. All I've ever wanted to do was sing. I don't want to be a celebrity. I don't want to be in people's faces, you know, constantly on covers of magazine that I haven't even known I'm on.	Adele	famous
I wanted to be successful, not famous.	George Harrison	famous
How many famous and high-spirited heroes have lived a day too long?	Jean-Jacques Rousseau	famous
Tom Cruise, he's a lot more famous than me.	David Beckham	famous
The hardest thing about being famous is that people are always nice to you. You're in a conversation and everybody's agreeing with what you're saying - even if you say something totally crazy. You need people who can tell you what you don't want to hear.	Al Pacino	famous
But I know newspapers. They have the first amendment and they can tell any lie knowing it's a lie and they're protected if the person's famous or it's a company.	Steve Wozniak	famous

I'm bored with that line. I never use it anymore. My new line is 'In 15 minutes everybody will be famous.'	Andy Warhol	famous

My idea of a good picture is one that's in focus and of a famous person.	Andy Warhol	famous
In the future everyone will be famous for 15 minutes.	Andy Warhol	famous

There's more pressure to be famous for being yourself than if you're being a character.	Kim Kardashian	famous

I've never sat there and plotted out how I was going to become successful or famous.	Jennifer Aniston	famous
It's interesting because people assume that because I'm famous I know all famous people.	Daniel Radcliffe	famous
I'm doing a new musical on Broadway, which opens in October called 'The Boy from Oz,' where I play Peter Allen. For those of you who don't know, he became first famous in America for marrying Liza Minelli.	Hugh Jackman	famous
There were a few years there when I was just so enamored with the idea of living some sort of famous person's lifestyle that really isn't suited to me.	Daniel Radcliffe	famous
I think it's useful, as a famous person, to have as little separation between the perception of you and how you really are - because otherwise I'd be sitting here thinking I'm keeping secrets, and wondering when you're going to find out.	Daniel Radcliffe	famous
I made my living being 20 or 30 pounds heavier than the average model. And that's where I got famous.	Tyra Banks	famous

I have no interest in Shakespeare and all that British nonsense... I just wanted to get famous and all the rest is hogwash.	Anthony Hopkins	famous
I certainly don't think you need to be famous to want to leave a legacy, but when you are famous, it's even more likely that your child will get the wrong perspective on your life if you die prematurely.	Shania Twain	famous
People just assume that if you're famous, you're in Hollywood.	Megan Fox	famous
Look at Jessica Simpson. She's famous for being dumb. I guess it started with Marylyn Monroe, and she actually wasn't that dumb, but that's how she was perceived - and that's what got popular.	Danica McKellar	famous
Because you know when you first become famous, you start walking a little different because people are staring at you.	Bono	famous
Famous people come up to me, but I don't know who they are because my sight is so bad. It's always at the pool of the Four Seasons in Beverly Hills when I don't have my lenses in and my glasses are in my room.	Helena Bonham Carter	famous
The worst thing about being famous is the invasion of your privacy.	Justin Timberlake	famous
You know, I did not like being famous. It was a stressful and ugly time, and I'm glad it's over.	Diablo Cody	famous
To enjoy being famous, you need to have a screw loose.	Diablo Cody	famous

I'm willing to make compromises based on someone I think is the one, but I think it's psychologically important to people when they're famous to be the only famous person they know.	John Mayer	famous
My hair was famous before I was.	Christopher Walken	famous
I'm English. Our dentistry is not world famous.	Christian Bale	famous
As a famous person you think how you're gonna end it, get away and have a normal life.	Gwen Stefani	famous
There are people who appear in the magazines and I don't know who they are. I've never seen anything they've done and their careers are over already. They're famous for maybe 10 minutes. Real careers, I think, take a long time to unfold.	Matt Damon	famous

I try to eat in a way that makes me feel good. If that means a little bite of chocolate I do that, but I try not to use food as a reward for myself.	Jennifer Garner	food

Give your kids a bloody knife and fork and let me put some fresh food in front of them they can eat.	Jamie Oliver	food

I want Americans to enjoy food. I want them to celebrate food. I want them to, on occasions, to have big cakes and great things. And I want them to indulge.	Jamie Oliver	food

Jamie Oliver	food
I get way too much happiness from good food.	Elizabeth Olsen	food

Because forgiveness is like this: a room can be dank because you have closed the windows, you've closed the curtains. But the sun is shining outside, and the air is fresh outside. In order to get that fresh air, you have to get up and open the window and draw the curtains apart.	Desmond Tutu	forgiveness

I think of a hero as someone who understands the degree of responsibility that comes with his freedom.	Bob Dylan	freedom

Mitt Romney	freedom
I believe in a religion that believes in freedom. Any time I have to accept a religion that won't let me fight a battle for my people, I say to hell with that religion.	Malcolm X	freedom

We, the People, recognize that we have responsibilities as well as rights that our destinies are bound together that a freedom which only asks what's in it for me, a freedom without a commitment to others, a freedom without love or charity or duty or patriotism, is unworthy of our founding ideals, and those who died in their defense.	Barack Obama	freedom
Freedom from effort in the present merely means that there has been effort stored up in the past.	Theodore Roosevelt	freedom
Our single most important challenge is therefore to help establish a social order in which the freedom of the individual will truly mean the freedom of the individual.	Nelson Mandela	freedom
If you're not ready to die for it, put the word 'freedom' out of your vocabulary.	Malcolm X	freedom

I wish that every human life might be pure transparent freedom.	Simone de Beauvoir	freedom
For more than four decades, the Libyan people have been ruled by a tyrant - Moammar Gaddafi.

Freedom isn't free. It shouldn't be a bragging point that 'Oh, I don't get involved in politics,' as if that makes someone cleaner. No, that makes you derelict of duty in a republic.

Our plans protect freedom and opportunity, and our blueprint is the Constitution of the United States.	Mitt Romney	freedom
If I am elected President of these United States, I will work with all my energy and soul to restore that America, to lift our eyes to a better future. That future is our destiny. That future is out there. It is waiting for us. Our children deserve it, our nation depends upon it, the peace and freedom of the world require it.	Mitt Romney	freedom
There are necessary evils. Money is an important thing in terms of representing freedom in our world. And now I have a daughter to think about. It's really the first time I've thought about the future and what it could be.	Johnny Depp	freedom
Perhaps religious conscience upsets the designs of those who feel that the highest wisdom and authority comes from government. But from the beginning, this nation trusted in God, not man. Religious liberty is the first freedom in our Constitution.	Mitt Romney	freedom
Religious freedom opens a door for Americans that is closed to too many others around the world. But whether we walk through that door, and what we do with our lives after we do, is up to us.	Mitt Romney	freedom
History does not long entrust the care of freedom to the weak or the timid.	Dwight D. Eisenhower	freedom

We still believe in the America that is a land of opportunity and a beacon of freedom. We believe in the America that challenges each of us to be better and bigger than ourselves.	Mitt Romney	freedom
Since Castro took power, the Cuban people have been denied basic human freedoms. No freedom of religion, no freedom of the press, no political freedom. And the regime uses brutality and violence to suppress these freedoms and impose its will.	Mitt Romney	freedom
Your true traveller finds boredom rather agreeable than painful. It is the symbol of his liberty - his excessive freedom. He accepts his boredom, when it comes, not merely philosophically, but almost with pleasure.	Aldous Huxley	freedom
Every friend of freedom must be as revolted as I am by the prospect of turning the United States into an armed camp, by the vision of jails filled with casual drug users and of an army of enforcers empowered to invade the liberty of citizens on slight evidence.	Milton Friedman	freedom
Back a hundred years ago, especially around Woodrow Wilson, what happened in this country is we took freedom and we chopped it into pieces.	Ron Paul	freedom

Make no mistake, in this campaign, I will offer the American ideals of economic freedom a clear and unapologetic defense.	Mitt Romney	freedom
President Obama orders religious organizations to violate their conscience. I will defend religious liberty and overturn regulations that trample on our first freedom.	Mitt Romney	freedom
I don't want to transform America. I want to restore to America the economic values of freedom and opportunity and limited government that has made us the powerhouse of the world.	Mitt Romney	freedom
The worst enemy of life, freedom and the common decencies is total anarchy their second worst enemy is total efficiency.	Aldous Huxley	freedom
There can be no real freedom without the freedom to fail.	Erich Fromm	freedom
The only way that has ever been discovered to have a lot of people cooperate together voluntarily is through the free market. And that's why it's so essential to preserving individual freedom.	Milton Friedman	freedom
No nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare.	James Madison	freedom

Analysis does not set out to make pathological reactions impossible, but to give the patient's ego freedom to decide one way or another.	Sigmund Freud	freedom

Freedom itself was attacked this morning by a faceless coward, and freedom will be defended.	George W. Bush	freedom

Who is more to be pitied, a writer bound and gagged by policemen or one living in perfect freedom who has nothing more to say?	Kurt Vonnegut	freedom

Exclusion is never the way forward on our shared paths to freedom and justice.	Desmond Tutu	freedom

None can love freedom heartily, but good men the rest love not freedom, but licence.	John Milton	freedom
Economic growth may one day turn out to be a curse rather than a good, and under no conditions can it either lead into freedom or constitute a proof for its existence.	Hannah Arendt	freedom

If the events of September 11, 2001, have proven anything, it's that the terrorists can attack us, but they can't take away what makes us American - our freedom, our liberty, our civil rights. No, only Attorney General John Ashcroft can do that.	Jon Stewart	freedom
Our culture is just a series of checks and balances. The whole idea that we're in a battle between tyranny and freedom - it's a series of pendulum swings.	Jon Stewart	freedom

Human beings want to be free and however long they may agree to stay locked up, to stay oppressed, there will come a time when they say 'That's it.'

Jimmy Wales	freedom
I don't believe in firing professors. They have academic freedom.	Alan Dershowitz	freedom

Trust is hard to come by. That's why my circle is small and tight. I'm kind of funny about making new friends.	Eminem	funny

You know, fame is a funny thing, man, especially, you know, actors, musicians, rappers, rock singers, it's kind of a lifestyle and it's easy to get caught up in it - you go to bars, you go to clubs, everyone's doing a certain thing... It's tough.	Eminem	funny

No matter how popular you are as a stand-up - you can go out and fill a 10,000-seat arena and be smart and funny - it's delicate to host an awards show and know where your place is and know that it's not about you, that it's about the people who are nominated, and respect that, but at the same time have your moment to show them who you are.

I never smoked. I never drank and I never took drugs. The funny thing is, nothing is more boring, people like this. For me, it's OK. But most of my friends, at least they smoke and drink.	Karl Lagerfeld	funny
One time I went into a restroom and a girl followed me in. I signed an autograph for her in the sink. It was pretty funny because she was in a guy's restroom and she wasn't embarrassed at all.	Zac Efron	funny
The people I grew up around who I really liked were quick on the draw. It always just wowed me. And my mum would make weird funny comments. I can see in myself her self-deprecating, hippie humour. I can't take myself too seriously.	Drew Barrymore	funny
I mean I've seen 3D films so far and I think it's a long way to go before they replace actors. It's a funny thing with 3D, I haven't quite got it yet. Yet.	Daniel Radcliffe	funny
I like funny guys and those, for some reason, tend to be nerdy guys.	Megan Fox	funny

I wanted to be that quirky girl who writes funny songs that still have meaning.	Katy Perry	funny
It's only I have seen enough of it and the funny thing is now, I know that I'm skinny, because I know there are even smaller clothes in the store. I think I'm big, when I was big, I never thought about it.	Karl Lagerfeld	funny
I find it so funny that people find me so interesting.	Britney Spears	funny
I had to act in a school play when I was about ten years old. I really didn't want to do it. But everyone had to do it so I didn't have a choice. A talent agent came and watched it and later gave me some work. It's funny because I'd always known that I wanted a movie career. I just didn't think that I would be in the movies.	Kristen Stewart	funny
I'm like, bursting. I should be working. I don't want to take a break. It's funny, on set, I don't have to go to the bathroom, I don't have anything wrong, I'm perfectly fine, so through-and-through. I'm not hungry. I'm literally not even in my own body.	Kristen Stewart	funny
It's a funny thing: You want so badly for people to see what you do - you're proud of it - and I like the effect that movies have on people. But the attention can also make me uncomfortable.	Kristen Stewart	funny
And I like to keep whatever is mine remaining that way. It's a funny little game to play and it's a slippery slope. I always say to myself I'm never going to give anything away because there's never any point or benefit for me.	Kristen Stewart	funny
There's something dangerous about what's funny. Jarring and disconcerting. There is a connection between funny and scary.	Christopher Walken	funny
Some people can do things and get away with it. Comics are famously like that. Why is it that some guys can say the most horrible things and it's not offensive, it's funny?	Christopher Walken	funny
I always like to watch comics and it's interesting that you can tell if someone's funny in 10 seconds.	Christopher Walken	funny
The funny thing is people won't let me pay for things. I'll be in a restaurant and the manager will say, 'Oh no, it's on the house.'	Richard Branson	funny
I find it very easy playing Bond. I think he's hilarious. He gets himself into some extraordinarily funny situations.	Daniel Craig	funny
Laurence Olivier said in an interview once that when he plays a tragedy he always aims for the funny parts, and the other way around. Because in a comedy you look for what's serious. I think that's true. Sometimes things are really funny if you're absolutely earnest. If you're really serious, it's hilarious.	Christopher Walken	funny
I never know when I am being funny, and the other way too. I don't think you can think about that. I don't think you can try to be funny. Some people are just funny.	Christopher Walken	funny
I'm just not one of those naturally funny, relaxed actors who enjoy the spotlight and are so good at it.	Heath Ledger	funny
It was always a fantasy of mine growing up - my favorite program was always 'Little House on the Prairie' - so I always wanted to wear those looks. When I was a child, I wouldn't let my mom put me in anything but calico dresses and now... whaddaya know, every day I'm in a calico dress, basically, so it's kind of funny.	Chloe Sevigny	funny
It's funny that there was so much disturbance about having a Catholic in the White House with Kennedy, and when we finally get a religion in the White House that's causing a lot of conflicts, and concerns, and disturbances for a lot of people, it's in the Bush Administration.	Roger Ebert	funny
You know, I've always thought that it would be really funny if somebody made a romantic comedy where absolutely everything went well from beginning to end.	Fiona Apple	funny
This is going to sound really funny. I have a poster of Zac Efron on my wall! I think every girl has a poster of him in their room so, why not join the club!	Vanessa Hudgens	funny
I think I have an inner confidence that my tastes are pretty simple, that what I find funny finds a wide audience. I'm not particularly intellectual or clever or minority-focused in my creative instincts. And I'm certainly not aware of suppressing more sophisticated ambitions.	Rowan Atkinson	funny
Funny things tend not to happen to me. I am not a natural comic. I need to think about things a lot before I can be even remotely amusing.	Rowan Atkinson	funny
It's funny how the hippies and the punks tried to get rid of the conservatives, but they always seem to get the upper hand in the end.	Bjork	funny
I recently spent quite a bit of time in Sheffield, England, which is where I'm from. I wouldn't move back there, but it's funny when you spend a bit of time in the place where you were brought up. You kind of realize how that place has had quite a big effect on you or made you a certain way.	Jarvis Cocker	funny
It's funny, because I never think of myself as Little Miss All-Together.	Courteney Cox	funny
When I was a kid I didn't feel like I fit in because - this is really silly and I probably shouldn't say it, but, I didn't think anything was funny. So I used to go home and literally cry to my mom and my step-dad at the time and I didn't think anything was funny. I couldn't laugh.	Courteney Cox	funny
Music is more difficult - try naming a political band. The Dead Kennedys. The Dead Kennedys are political, but they are more funny than they are political.	Thom Yorke	funny
Comedians don't laugh. They're too busy analyzing why it's funny or not.	James Lipton	funny
Also, in a funny way, if you have been happily married there are no unresolved areas, nothing to prove to yourself after the other dies.	Nigella Lawson	funny
I think 'Saturday Night Live', starting in the 1970s, really gave women an outlet to be funny. A lot of those women went on to have film careers, from Kristen Wiig now to Tina Fey and Gilda Radner.	Emma Stone	funny
It's so funny, because right now I'm very tired and my brains a little dead, I tend to get very focused and serious. So, I'm probably coming off a lot more like Scully right now.	Gillian Anderson	funny
It's a required part of your film history to know who Woody is. His movies are so wonderful, and not just funny but so insightful about human behavior.	Scarlett Johansson	funny
I've dated some women who have turned me on to some funny things that are strange for men to actually do, but these things have become part of my process. I think the things I do for my appearance help make me look better. I even colour my hair because I like how it makes me look.	Ryan Seacrest	funny
I do find comedy difficult. I don't know why. Maybe I think about it too much. There's a tremendous amount of pressure to be funny.	Michelle Pfeiffer	funny
It's funny that it all becomes about clothes. It's bizarre. You work your butt off and then you win an award and it's all about your dress. You can't get away from it.	Reese Witherspoon	funny
I was not particularly bright, I wasn't very athletic, I was a little too tall, odd, funny looking, I was just really weird as a kid.	Uma Thurman	funny
So often, I read scripts and am like, 'This would never happen in real life. It's not trying to be funny. It's trying to be serious.'	Shailene Woodley	funny
It's funny, growing up there was never anybody around me with any kind of artistic bent.	Nick Offerman	funny
Sometimes in the most tragic situation, something just profoundly funny happens.	David Hyde Pierce	funny
If you can find the line between sympathetic and creepy, you have reached a very funny area.	Jason Segel	funny
My parents are both very funny but they're also relatively soft-spoken, normal human beings while I'm just a lunatic. I don't know where this loud, ballsy, hammy ridiculousness came from. I'm just glad I followed my goals and my parents did too. It's not like we even had a plan when I dragged my mom to Los Angeles.	Emma Stone	funny
The empires of the future are the empires of the mind.	Winston Churchill	future
Every saint has a past and every sinner has a future.	Oscar Wilde	future
Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.

Real generosity toward the future lies in giving all to the present.	Albert Camus	future
Go for it now. The future is promised to no one.	Wayne Dyer	future

The American people I talk to don't spend every moment thinking, 'How can I tax my neighbor more than they're being taxed?' They say, 'How can I get a good job? How can my kids get good jobs? How can seniors have a confidence in their future when they know that Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid are bankrupt?'	Mitt Romney	future
Internationally, President Obama has adopted an appeasement strategy. He believes America's role as leader in the world is a thing of the past. I believe a strong America must - and will - lead the future.	Mitt Romney	future

The problem with the future is that it keeps turning into the present.	Bill Watterson	future

I suppose I'm intrigued with the bad traits of society, because I'm a part of society, and the bad traits pose the dangerous questions for our future.	Jude Law	future

You never know what the future brings.	Randy Jackson	future

I believe in God, but not as one thing, not as an old man in the sky. I believe that what people call God is something in all of us. I believe that what Jesus and Mohammed and Buddha and all the rest said was right. It's just that the translations have gone wrong.	John Lennon	god
I just want to do God's will. And he's allowed me to go to the mountain. And I've looked over, and I've seen the promised land! I may not get there with you, but I want you to know tonight that we as a people will get to the promised land.	Martin Luther King, Jr.	god

Surely God would not have created such a being as man, with an ability to grasp the infinite, to exist only for a day! No, no, man was made for immortality.	Abraham Lincoln	god

We don't have enough support for maternal leave and the kinds of things that some of the European countries do.

Hillary Clinton	good
Hell isn't merely paved with good intentions it's walled and roofed with them. Yes, and furnished too.	Aldous Huxley	good
Dedicate yourself to the good you deserve and desire for yourself. Give yourself peace of mind. You deserve to be happy. You deserve delight.	Hannah Arendt	good
Julia progresses from cradle to grave, showing how government makes every good thing in her life possible.

Mitt Romney	good
I wasn't in school often enough to really belong to a 'clique,' but my friends all studied hard and got pretty good grades. They were good people with self-respect.

What does it say about the fiction of old liberalism to insist that good jobs and good schools and good wages will result from policies that have failed us, time and again?	Mitt Romney	good
And that's how it is in America. We look to our communities, our faiths, our families for our joy, our support, in good times and bad. It is both how we live our lives and why we live our lives.	Mitt Romney	good

The good old days, when each idea had an owner, are gone forever.	Paulo Coelho	good

The most savage controversies are about matters as to which there is no good evidence either way.	Bertrand Russell	good
I've gone for each type: the rough guy the nerdy, sweet, lovable guy and the slick guy. I don't really have a type. Men in general are a good thing.	Jennifer Aniston	good
But the real secret to lifelong good health is actually the opposite: Let your body take care of you.	Deepak Chopra	good
There's no regret. You can't regret. I mean, I've felt regret but I've also refused to allow regret to sow a seed and live in me because I don't believe it.

The government solution to a problem is usually as bad as the problem.	Milton Friedman	government

Democracy is worth dying for, because it's the most deeply honorable form of government ever devised by man.	Ronald Reagan	government
I own that I am not a friend to a very energetic government. It is always oppressive.	Thomas Jefferson	government
So confident am I in the intentions, as well as wisdom, of the government, that I shall always be satisfied that what is not done, either cannot, or ought not to be done.	Thomas Jefferson	government
That government is the strongest of which every man feels himself a part.	Thomas Jefferson	government
No government ought to be without censors and where the press is free no one ever will.	Thomas Jefferson	government
Behind the ostensible government sits enthroned an invisible government owing no allegiance and acknowledging no responsibility to the people.	Theodore Roosevelt	government
The taxpayer - that's someone who works for the federal government but doesn't have to take the civil service examination.	Ronald Reagan	government
The second office in the government is honorable and easy the first is but a splendid misery.	Thomas Jefferson	government
Government always finds a need for whatever money it gets.	Ronald Reagan	government
One way to make sure crime doesn't pay would be to let the government run it.	Ronald Reagan	government
Protecting the rights of even the least individual among us is basically the only excuse the government has for even existing.	Ronald Reagan	government
Over grown military establishments are under any form of government inauspicious to liberty, and are to be regarded as particularly hostile to republican liberty.	George Washington	government
The only power any government has is the power to crack down on criminals. Well, when there aren't enough criminals, one makes them. One declares so many things to be a crime that it becomes impossible for men to live without breaking laws.	Ayn Rand	government
Today, if you invent a better mousetrap, the government comes along with a better mouse.	Ronald Reagan	government
I think that people want peace so much that one of these days government had better get out of their way and let them have it.	Dwight D. Eisenhower	government
Different men seek after happiness in different ways and by different means, and so make for themselves different modes of life and forms of government.	Aristotle	government
The basis of our political system is the right of the people to make and to alter their constitutions of government.	George Washington	government
When the federal government spends more each year than it collects in tax revenues, it has three choices: It can raise taxes, print money, or borrow money. While these actions may benefit politicians, all three options are bad for average Americans.	Ron Paul	government
If the people cannot trust their government to do the job for which it exists - to protect them and to promote their common welfare - all else is lost.	Barack Obama	government
Mankind, when left to themselves, are unfit for their own government.	George Washington	government
If you like small government you need to work hard at having a strong national defense that is not so militant. Personal liberty is the purpose of government, to protect liberty - not to run your personal life, not to run the economy, and not to pretend that we can tell the world how they ought to live.	Ron Paul	government
By definition, a government has no conscience. Sometimes it has a policy, but nothing more.	Albert Camus	government
It may be laid down as a primary position, and the basis of our system, that every Citizen who enjoys the protection of a Free Government, owes not only a proportion of his property, but even of his personal services to the defense of it.	George Washington	government
The government is us we are the government, you and I.	Theodore Roosevelt	government
The administration of justice is the firmest pillar of government.	George Washington	government

An ideal form of government is democracy tempered with assassination.	Voltaire	government
It's not tyranny we desire it's a just, limited, federal government.	Alexander Hamilton	government
I believe there is something out there watching us. Unfortunately, it's the government.	Woody Allen	government
Now, let me be clear. The path I lay out is not one paved with ever increasing government checks and cradle to grave assurance that government will always be the solution. If this election is a bidding war for who can promise the most goodies and the most benefits, I'm not your president. You have that president today.	Mitt Romney	government
There are many people who feel that it is useless and futile to continue talking about peace and non-violence against a government whose only reply is savage attacks on an unarmed and defenceless people.	Nelson Mandela	government
Many people want the government to protect the consumer. A much more urgent problem is to protect the consumer from the government.	Milton Friedman	government
There is danger from all men. The only maxim of a free government ought to be to trust no man living with power to endanger the public liberty.	John Adams	government
I spent my whole life in the private sector, 25 years in the private sector. I understand that when government takes more money out of the hands of people, it makes it more difficult for them to buy things. If they can't buy things, the economy doesn't grow. If the economy doesn't grow, we don't put Americans to work.	Mitt Romney	government
The Great Depression, like most other periods of severe unemployment, was produced by government mismanagement rather than by any inherent instability of the private economy.	Milton Friedman	government
I am sometimes a fox and sometimes a lion. The whole secret of government lies in knowing when to be the one or the other.	Napoleon Bonaparte	government
When one gets in bed with government, one must expect the diseases it spreads.	Ron Paul	government
I am absolutely opposed to a national ID card. This is a total contradiction of what a free society is all about. The purpose of government is to protect the secrecy and the privacy of all individuals, not the secrecy of government. We don't need a national ID card.	Ron Paul	government
The Internet didn't get invented on its own. Government research created the Internet so that all the companies could make money off the Internet. The point is, is that when we succeed, we succeed because of our individual initiative, but also because we do things together.	Barack Obama	government
The happiness of society is the end of government.	John Adams	government
The ideal form of government is democracy tempered with assassination.	Voltaire	government
Government is taking 40 percent of the GDP. And that's at the state, local and federal level. President Obama has taken government spending at the federal level from 20 percent to 25 percent. Look, at some point, you cease being a free economy, and you become a government economy. And we've got to stop that.	Mitt Romney	government
I'm not really conservative. I'm conservative on certain things. I believe in less government. I believe in fiscal responsibility and all those things that maybe Republicans used to believe in but don't any more.	Clint Eastwood	government
There is nothing wrong with describing Conservatism as protecting the Constitution, protecting all things that limit government. Government is the enemy of liberty. Government should be very restrained.	Ron Paul	government
And a special thank you to the citizens of Massachusetts: You are paying all the taxes, creating all the jobs, raising all the children. This government is yours. Thank you for letting me serve you. I love this job.	Mitt Romney	government
The world runs on individuals pursuing their self interests. The great achievements of civilization have not come from government bureaus. Einstein didn't construct his theory under order from a, from a bureaucrat. Henry Ford didn't revolutionize the automobile industry that way.	Milton Friedman	government
Free enterprise has done more to lift people out of poverty, to help build a strong middle class, to help educate our kids, and to make our lives better than all the programs of government combined.	Mitt Romney	government
The United States Constitution has proved itself the most marvelously elastic compilation of rules of government ever written.	Franklin D. Roosevelt	government
Liberty has never come from Government. Liberty has always come from the subjects of it. The history of liberty is a history of limitations of governmental power, not the increase of it.	Woodrow Wilson	government
Why has government been instituted at all? Because the passions of man will not conform to the dictates of reason and justice without constraint.	Alexander Hamilton	government
Just think of what Woodrow Wilson stood for: he stood for world government. He wanted an early United Nations, League of Nations. But it was the conservatives, Republicans, that stood up against him.	Ron Paul	government
Nothing is so permanent as a temporary government program.	Milton Friedman	government
The right way to reign in healthcare costs is not by applying more government and more controls and making it more like the post office, it's by making it more like a consumer-driven market.	Mitt Romney	government
You balance the budget by restraining the growth of government and encouraging the growth of the private sector.	Mitt Romney	government
By making bold cuts in spending and commonsense entitlement reforms, we will make our government simpler, smaller, and smarter.	Mitt Romney	government
It's opportunity. It's opportunity, not a check from government - it's opportunity that has always driven America and defined us as Americans.	Mitt Romney	government
The answer for healthcare is market incentives, not healthcare by a Godzilla-sized government bureaucracy.	Mitt Romney	government
I would cap the amount of federal government can spend at 20 percent of the economy. Bring it back to 20 percent or lower. And say, we are not going to spend above that level. Democrats, they want to raise your taxes and spend more and more and turn us into an economy which is no longer driven by the private sector.	Mitt Romney	government
Our nation is too different, too diverse to say that what works in Massachusetts is somehow going to be grabbed by the federal government, usurping the power of states and imposing a one-size-fits-all plan on the nation. That will not work.	Mitt Romney	government
On one of the most personal matters of our lives, our health care, President Obama would turn decision making over to government bureaucrats. He forced through Obama-care and I will repeal it.	Mitt Romney	government
Democrats want to use the slowdown as an excuse to do what their special interests are always begging for: higher taxes, bigger government and less trade with other nations.	Mitt Romney	government
No government can help the destinies of people who insist in putting sectional and class consciousness ahead of general weal.	Franklin D. Roosevelt	government
I had the privilege of practicing medicine in the early '60s, before we had any government. It worked rather well, and there was nobody on the street suffering with no medical care.	Ron Paul	government
Well private money can take risks in a way that government money often isn't willing to.	Bill Gates	government
All government, indeed every human benefit and enjoyment, every virtue, and every prudent act, is founded on compromise and barter.	Edmund Burke	government
Government does not create wealth. The major role for the government is to create an environment where people take risks to expand the job rate in the United States.	George W. Bush	government
Most of the energy of political work is devoted to correcting the effects of mismanagement of government.	Milton Friedman	government
A government of laws, and not of men.	John Adams	government
Those who want the Government to regulate matters of the mind and spirit are like men who are so afraid of being murdered that they commit suicide to avoid assassination.	Harry S. Truman	government
Even to observe neutrality you must have a strong government.	Alexander Hamilton	government
We are beginning a new era in our government. I cannot too strongly urge the necessity of a rigid economy and an inflexible determination not to enlarge the income beyond the real necessities of the government.	Andrew Jackson	government
The federal government has sponsored research that has produced a tomato that is perfect in every respect, except that you can't eat it. We should make every effort to make sure this disease, often referred to as 'progress', doesn't spread.	Andy Rooney	government
As I speak to you today, government censors somewhere are working furiously to erase my words from the records of history. But history itself has already condemned these tactics.	Hillary Clinton	government
A little group of willful men, representing no opinion but their own, have rendered the great government of the United States helpless and contemptible.	Woodrow Wilson	government
One of my goals upon becoming Secretary of State was to take diplomacy out of capitals, out of government offices, into the media, into the streets of countries.	Hillary Clinton	government
The nuclear arsenal that Pakistan has, I believe is secure. I think the government and the military have taken adequate steps to protect that.	Hillary Clinton	government
If you are working 50 hours a week in a factory, you don't have time to read 10 newspapers a day and go back to declassified government archives. But such people may have far-reaching insights into the way the world works.	Noam Chomsky	government
Nothing turns out to be so oppressive and unjust as a feeble government.	Edmund Burke	government
You know why there's a Second Amendment? In case the government fails to follow the first one.	Rush Limbaugh	government
While all other sciences have advanced, that of government is at a standstill - little better understood, little better practiced now than three or four thousand years ago.	John Adams	government
I don't think the government is out to get me or help someone else get me but it wouldn't surprise me if they were out to sell me something or help someone else sell me something. I mean, why else would the Census Bureau want to know my telephone number?	Andy Rooney	government
And I have no doubt that every new example will succeed, as every past one has done, in showing that religion and Government will both exist in greater purity, the less they are mixed together.	James Madison	government
As long as our government is administered for the good of the people, and is regulated by their will as long as it secures to us the rights of persons and of property, liberty of conscience and of the press, it will be worth defending.	Andrew Jackson	government
The black market was a way of getting around government controls. It was a way of enabling the free market to work. It was a way of opening up, enabling people.	Milton Friedman	government
A popular government without popular information or the means of acquiring it, is but a prologue to a farce, or a tragedy, or perhaps both.	James Madison	government
The essence of a free government consists in an effectual control of rivalries.	John Adams	government
The government of the United States is a device for maintaining in perpetuity the rights of the people, with the ultimate extinction of all privileged classes.	Calvin Coolidge	government
Any government that supports, protects or harbours terrorists is complicit in the murder of the innocent and equally guilty of terrorist crimes.	George W. Bush	government
War should only be declared by the authority of the people, whose toils and treasures are to support its burdens, instead of the government which is to reap its fruits.	James Madison	government
I know it's going to be the private sector that leads this country out of the current economic times we're in. You can spend your money better than the government can spend your money.	George W. Bush	government
I hope all of you are going to fill out your census form when it comes in the mail next month. If you don't return the form the area you live in might get less government money and you wouldn't want that to happen, would you.	Andy Rooney	government
A President needs political understanding to run the government, but he may be elected without it.	Harry S. Truman	government
We need to understand that we as citizens and as a government in any community throughout this country have no more important obligation than to educate those who are going to replace us.	Colin Powell	government
When you have an efficient government, you have a dictatorship.	Harry S. Truman	government
Government's first duty and highest obligation is public safety.	Arnold Schwarzenegger	government
By a continuing process of inflation, government can confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth of their citizens.	John Maynard Keynes	government
When you decide to get involved in a military operation in a place like Syria, you've got to be prepared, as we learned from Iraq and Afghanistan, to become the government, and I'm not sure any country, either the United States or I don't hear of anyone else, who's willing to take on that responsibility.	Colin Powell	government
The most important ways in which I think the Internet will affect the big issue is that it will make it more difficult for government to collect taxes.	Milton Friedman	government
I have no doubt but that the misery of the lower classes will be found to abate whenever the Government assumes a freer aspect and the laws favor a subdivision of Property.	James Madison	government
The people are the only legitimate fountain of power, and it is from them that the constitutional charter, under which the several branches of government hold their power, is derived.	James Madison	government
We got rid of a terrible dictator. We gave the Iraqi people an opportunity for a new life under a representative form of government.	Colin Powell	government
We all hoped in 2001 that we could put in place an Afghan government under President Karzai that would be able to control the country, make sure al-Qaeda didn't come back, and make sure the Taliban wasn't resurging. It didn't work out.	Colin Powell	government
Money is power, and in that government which pays all the public officers of the states will all political power be substantially concentrated.	Andrew Jackson	government
Government has no other end, but the preservation of property.	John Locke	government
The essence of Government is power and power, lodged as it must be in human hands, will ever be liable to abuse.	James Madison	government
To restore the trust of the people, we must reform the way the government operates.	Arnold Schwarzenegger	government
In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men you must first enable the government to control the governed and in the next place oblige it to control itself.	James Madison	government
We are a forward-looking people, and we must have a forward-looking government.	Arnold Schwarzenegger	government
I feel good because I believe I have made progress in rebuilding the people's trust in their government.	Arnold Schwarzenegger	government
As president, Reagan worked very well with Democrats to do big things. It is true that he worked to reduce the size of government and cut federal taxes and he eliminated many regulations, but he also raised taxes when necessary.	Arnold Schwarzenegger	government
The diversity in the faculties of men, from which the rights of property originate, is not less an insuperable obstacle to an uniformity of interests. The protection of these faculties is the first object of government.	James Madison	government
What is government itself but the greatest of all reflections on human nature? If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary.	James Madison	government
To suppose that any form of government will secure liberty or happiness without any virtue in the people, is a chimerical idea.	James Madison	government
A politician is a man who understands government. A statesman is a politician who's been dead for 15 years.	Harry S. Truman	government
A pure democracy is a society consisting of a small number of citizens, who assemble and administer the government in person.	James Madison	government
There are no necessary evils in government. Its evils exist only in its abuses.	Andrew Jackson	government
The rights of persons, and the rights of property, are the objects, for the protection of which Government was instituted.	James Madison	government
Barack Obama's enemies are the people who make this country work. Barack Obama's enemies are those who succeed. Those are the people whose income he wants to redistribute. Those are the people whose income he wants to take, using the power and the force of the federal government to do it.	Rush Limbaugh	government
Religion flourishes in greater purity, without than with the aid of Government.	James Madison	government
Everything government touches turns to crap.	Ringo Starr	government
I cannot consent that my mortal body shall be laid in a repository prepared for an Emperor or a King my republican feelings and principles forbid it the simplicity of our system of government forbids it.	Andrew Jackson	government
We should reject big government and look inside ourselves for all the things that built this country into what it was.	Glenn Beck	government
The control of information is something the elite always does, particularly in a despotic form of government. Information, knowledge, is power. If you can control information, you can control people.	Tom Clancy	government
People forget... that we structured it so that the government, or the people, would be repaid with a really good rate of return. And as it turns out, that aspect of TARP, that's what happened.	George W. Bush	government
That's the definition of 'success' for the modern Democrat Party. As many people dependent on government as possible is the objective.	Rush Limbaugh	government
You could afford your house without the government if it weren't for the government.	Rush Limbaugh	government
Liberal Democrats are inexorably opposed to tax cuts, because tax cuts give people more power, and take away from the role of government.	Rush Limbaugh	government
I want anyone who believes in life, liberty, pursuit of happiness to succeed. And I want any force, any person, any element of an overarching Big Government that would stop your success, I want that organization, that element or that person to fail. I want you to succeed.	Rush Limbaugh	government
Government stimulates the democrat party.	Rush Limbaugh	government
The Federal Government should be the last resort, not the first. Ask if a potential program is truly a federal responsibility or whether it can better be handled privately, by voluntary organizations, or by local or state governments.	Donald Rumsfeld	government
If Bush, as I believe, has reliable information on the fact that Saddam Hussein is making weapons of mass destruction, I cannot not support the policies of his government.	Steven Spielberg	government
The most cogent reason for restricting the interference of government is the great evil of adding unnecessarily to its power.	John Stuart Mill	government
It is not an arrogant government that chooses priorities, it's an irresponsible government that fails to choose.	Tony Blair	government
I am concerned about the whole man. I am concerned about what the people, using their government as an instrument and a tool, can do toward building the whole man, which will mean a better society and a better world.	Lyndon B. Johnson	government
Many people around the President have sizeable egos before entering government, some with good reason. Their new positions will do little to moderate their egos.	Donald Rumsfeld	government
Democracy is when the people keep a government in check.	Aung San Suu Kyi	government
Peace as a goal is an ideal which will not be contested by any government or nation, not even the most belligerent.	Aung San Suu Kyi	government
Every wise, just, and mild government, by rendering the condition of its subjects easy and secure, will always abound most in people, as well as in commodities and riches.	David Hume	government
Democracy is not so much a form of government as a set of principles.	Woodrow Wilson	government
In the late 1990s, some of the worst terrorist atrocities in the world were what the Turkish government itself called state terror, namely massive atrocities, 80 percent of the arms coming from the United States, millions of refugees, tens of thousands of people killed, hideous repression, that's international terror, and we can go on and on.	Noam Chomsky	government
I can't really criticize the Tea Party people, because I came into the White House pretty much on the same basis that they have become popular. That is dissatisfaction with the way things are going in Washington and disillusionment and disencouragement about the government.	Jimmy Carter	government
To reduce deficit spending and our enormous debt, you reign in spending. You cut the budget. You don't take more from the private sector and grow government with it. And that's exactly what Obama has in mind with this expiration of Bush tax cuts proposal of his.	Sarah Palin	government
If there are men in this country big enough to own the government of the United States, they are going to own it.	Woodrow Wilson	government
The awakening of the people of China to the possibilities under free government is the most significant, if not the most momentous, event of our generation.	Woodrow Wilson	government
It was settled by the Constitution, the laws, and the whole practice of the government that the entire executive power is vested in the President of the United States.	Andrew Jackson	government
Government is a contrivance of human wisdom to provide for human wants. People have the right to expect that these wants will be provided for by this wisdom.	Jimmy Carter	government
It's very difficult for the American people to believe that our government, one of the richest on Earth, is also one of the stingiest on Earth.	Jimmy Carter	government
As someone who worked hard for a Labour victory in the 90s, do I regret it? Not really. It was bound to happen. And it'll happen with the next government, and the one after it. Because all governments serve us. They serve the filth.	Stephen Fry	government
We tried to have diplomas without learning, we tried to have jobs without work, we tried to have houses without savings, we tried to have government without responsibility.	Newt Gingrich	government
It is time we passed a balanced budget amendment and return this government to limited spending.	Newt Gingrich	government
The time has come to tell the truth about the corruption of the government employee unions in this country.	Newt Gingrich	government
Surely the President can agree with us, that theft from government is not good. I know it's bold. It's out on the edge. I know from a Chicago-Springfield background it's hard to fully grasp that honesty could be part of government.	Newt Gingrich	government
People should be free, people should be unencumbered by regulation as much as possible, that big government always goes corrupt and the truth shall always set you free.	Glenn Beck	government
Both my parents are English and came out to Australia in 1967. I was born the following year. My parents, and immigrants like them, were known as '&pound10 poms.' Back then, the Australian government was trying to get educated British people and Canadians - to be honest, educated white people - to come and live in Australia.	Hugh Jackman	government
While democracy in the long run is the most stable form of government, in the short run, it is among the most fragile.	Madeleine Albright	government
'Hello my name is the Republican Party and I got a problem. I'm addicted to spending and big government.' I'd like one of them just to stand up and say that.	Glenn Beck	government
Wherever magistrates were appointed from among those who complied with the injunctions of the laws, Socrates considered the government to be an aristocracy.	Xenophon	government
Folks, this government isn't too big to fail, it's too big to succeed.	Sarah Palin	government
Every government must consider the security of the country. That is just part of the responsibilities of any government. But true security can only come out of unity within a country where there are so many ethnic nationalities.	Aung San Suu Kyi	government
I am often asked if, when I was secretary, I had problems with foreign men. That is not who I had problems with, because I arrived in a very large plane that said United States of America. I had more problems with the men in our own government.	Madeleine Albright	government
I wasn't a normal professor. I had worked in government. I hadn't written nine zillion books. I was a hands-on professor.	Madeleine Albright	government
People know something has gone terribly wrong with our government and it has gotten so far off track. But people also know that there is nothing wrong in America that a good old-fashioned election can't fix.	Sarah Palin	government
President Reagan was elected on the promise of getting government off the backs of the people and now he demands that government wrap itself around the waists of the people.	Ralph Nader	government
Every time the government grows we lose more of who we are.	Glenn Beck	government
Candidly, I believe most corporations actually don't mind big government.	Rick Santorum	government
When a nation is over-reliant on one or two commodities like oil or precious minerals, corrupt government ministers and their dodgy associates hoard profits and taxes instead of properly allocating them to schools and hospitals.	Bono	government
A president who breaks the law is a threat to the very structure of our government.	Al Gore	government
We just put General Motors in the hands of people who can't even run our own government.	Glenn Beck	government
I cannot think of any circumstances in which a government can go to war without the support of parliament.	Tony Blair	government
In government you carry each hope each disillusion. And in politics it's always about the next challenge.	Tony Blair	government
I work for a Government I despise for ends I think criminal.	John Maynard Keynes	government
I really do inhabit a system in which words are capable of shaking the entire structure of government, where words can prove mightier than ten military divisions.	Vaclav Havel	government
Well, I thought the deal was, when you went to work for the government you weren't supposed to make money!	Joe Biden	government
Women ought to have representatives, instead of being arbitrarily governed without any direct share allowed them in the deliberations of government.	Mary Wollstonecraft	government
I've been in and out of Wall Street since 1949, and I've never seen the type of animosity between government and Wall Street. And I'm not sure where it comes from, but I suspect it's got to do with a general schism in this society which is really becoming ever more destructive.	Alan Greenspan	government
Taxes are like abortion, and not just because both are grotesque procedures supported by Democrats. You're for them or against them. Taxes go up or down government raises taxes or lowers them. But Democrats will not let the words 'abortion' or 'tax hikes' pass their lips.	Ann Coulter	government
An interim government was set up in Afghanistan. It included two women, one of whom was Minister of Women's Affairs. Man, who'd she have to show here ankles to to get that job?	Tina Fey	government
Power without principle is barren, but principle without power is futile. This is a party of government, and I will lead it as a party of government.	Tony Blair	government
Common sense tells us that the government's attempts to solve large problems more often create new ones. Common sense also tells us that a top-down, one-size-fits-all plan will not improve the workings of a nationwide health-care system that accounts for one-sixth of our economy.	Sarah Palin	government
Our government needs to adopt a pro-market agenda that doesn't pick winners and losers, but it invites competition and it levels the playing field for everyone.	Sarah Palin	government
I strive never to forget the real world consequences of my decisions on individuals, businesses and government.	Sonia Sotomayor	government
If I was afraid of being killed, I would never speak out against the government.	Aung San Suu Kyi	government
My opinion is the greatest reward that any government could get is the approval of the people. If the people are happy and the people are at peace and the government has done something for them, that's the greatest reward I think any government could hope for.	Aung San Suu Kyi	government
It's dismaying to see the unilateralism that the government is doing.	Edward Norton	government
I almost forgot what it's like to be proud of my government.	Edward Norton	government
Let's just do what is right for the American people. And those of us who are involved in politics and government know that our responsibility is to the American people, that we have a responsibility to find our common ground, to seek it and to find it.	Nancy Pelosi	government
There's something fundamentally wrong with a system where there's been 17 years of a Tory Government and the people of Scotland have voted Socialist for 17 years. That hardly seems democratic.	Sean Connery	government
The government of Israel doesn't like the kinds of things I say, which puts them into the same category as every other government in the world.	Noam Chomsky	government
You can't fall back on the private sector and say, 'You take care of the nation's banking system.' That's a fundamental function of the government, the Federal Reserve, the Treasury and the FDIC, etc. All of those agencies have a major role to play there.	Dick Cheney	government
In the Pentagon Papers case, the government asserted in the Supreme Court that the publication of the material was a threat to national security. It turned out it was not a threat to U.S. security. But even if it had been, that doesn't mean that it couldn't be published.	Alan Dershowitz	government
We all learn in school that the judicial, legislative and executive branches of government must check and balance each other. But other non state institutions must participate in this important system of checks and balances as well. These checking institutions include the academy, the media, religious institutions and NGOs.	Alan Dershowitz	government
I always wanted to have my own album released before I graduated from high school.	Christina Aguilera	graduation
In this outward and physical ceremony we attest once again to the inner and spiritual strength of our Nation. As my high school teacher, Miss Julia Coleman, used to say: 'We must adjust to changing times and still hold to unchanging principles.'	Jimmy Carter	graduation
I got all my work done to graduate in two months and then they were like, I'm sorry, you have to take driver's ed. I just kind of went, Oh, forget it.	Fiona Apple	graduation
From kindergarten to graduation, I went to public schools, and I know that they are a key to being sure that every child has a chance to succeed and to rise in the world.	Dick Cheney	graduation
Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds.	Albert Einstein	great
Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them.	William Shakespeare	great
The great question that has never been answered, and which I have not yet been able to answer, despite my thirty years of research into the feminine soul, is 'What does a woman want?'	Sigmund Freud	great

I do have my ducks in line if I want to do it, but I'd love to see the Republicans pick somebody that was going to win and take over this country and frankly, to use the expression, 'Make America great again.'	Donald Trump	great
A lot of people feel very good about Mitt Romney and I think he's going to do a great job.	Donald Trump	great
Mitt - what I speak to Mitt Romney about is jobs.

Donald Trump	great
It's a great thing when you can show that you've been successful and that you've made a lot of money and that you've employed a lot of people.	Donald Trump	great
Obama has no solutions. Obama has failed the country and its great citizens, and they don't like it when somebody such as myself speaks the truth about this - it hurts too much.	Donald Trump	great

It is of great use to the sailor to know the length of his line, though he cannot with it fathom all the depths of the ocean.	John Locke	great

Don't get involved in partial problems, but always take flight to where there is a free view over the whole single great problem, even if this view is still not a clear one.	Ludwig Wittgenstein	great

Children are our second chance to have a great parent-child relationship.	Laura Schlessinger	great

And so our goal on health care is, if we can get, instead of health care costs going up 6 percent a year, it's going up at the level of inflation, maybe just slightly above inflation, we've made huge progress.

Obama's health care plan will be written by a committee whose head, John Conyers, says he doesn't understand it.

What could possibly go wrong?	Rush Limbaugh	health
But if you - if what - the reports are true, what they're saying is, is that as a consequence of us getting 30 million additional people health care, at the margins that's going to increase our costs, we knew that.	Barack Obama	health
Women in particular need to keep an eye on their physical and mental health, because if we're scurrying to and from appointments and errands, we don't have a lot of time to take care of ourselves. We need to do a better job of putting ourselves higher on our own 'to do' list.	Michelle Obama	health
Addiction should never be treated as a crime. It has to be treated as a health problem. We do not send alcoholics to jail in this country. Over 500,000 people are in our jails who are nonviolent drug users.	Ralph Nader	health

I've never had very high regard for therapists. I owe my health, my mental survival, to my friends and loved ones.	Salman Rushdie	health
The awareness that health is dependent upon habits that we control makes us the first generation in history that to a large extent determines its own destiny.	Jimmy Carter	health

When it comes to the health of our families, Barack refused to listen to all those folks who told him to leave health reform for another day, another president.

It's bizarre that the produce manager is more important to my children's health than the pediatrician.	Meryl Streep	health
The fact is that we would have had comprehensive health care now, had it not been for Ted Kennedy's deliberately blocking the legislation that I proposed in 1978 or '79.	Jimmy Carter	health
I think all Americans believe in human rights. And health is an often overlooked aspect of basic human rights. And it's one that's easily corrected. The reason I say that is that many of the diseases that we treat around the world, I knew when I was a child. My mother was a registered nurse. And they no longer exist in our country.	Jimmy Carter	health
I think it's horrible that people have to be told. Don't smoke! Everybody knows it's bad for the health. But they have to forbid it.	Karl Lagerfeld	health
There are less than 1 per cent of anorexic girls, but there more than 30 per cent of girls in France - I don't know about England - that are much, much overweight. And it is much more dangerous and very bad for the health.	Karl Lagerfeld	health
America doesn't have health insurance.	Joe Biden	health
In order to lead a country or a company, you've got to get everybody on the same page and you've got to be able to have a vision of where you're going. America can't have a vision of health care for everybody, green economy, regulations - can't have a bunch of piece-meal activities. It's got to have a vision.	Jack Welch	health
If I were a capitalist I would not give my employees health insurance with no deductible, which I do, including dental, and paid pregnancy leave. That's not called capitalism, that's called being a Christian and someone who believes in democracy, so that everyone should get a fair slice of the pie.	Michael Moore	health
Dick Cheney said he was running again. He said his health was fine, 'I've got a doctor with me 24 hours a day.' Yeah, that's always the sign of a man in good health, isn't it?	David Letterman	health
Think of an economy where people could be an artist or a photographer or a writer without worrying about keeping their day job in order to have health insurance.	Nancy Pelosi	health
I think about my parents all the time, especially on Sunday when I'm at Mass. My mother always said, 'We do not pray to win elections. We pray for people's health, we pray that God's will be done, we pray that we do our best. But we do not pray to win elections.'	Nancy Pelosi	health
Because of the president's leadership, every American will have access to affordable, quality health care.	Rahm Emanuel	health
Make no mistake, a 'yes' vote on the Democrats' health care bill is a vote for taxpayer-funded abortions.	John Boehner	health
The public health of five million children should not be left to luck or chance.	Jamie Oliver	health
Well, the truth is that a lot of people lie about their health, they lie about the finances, they lie about things at work, they lie about things.	Laura Schlessinger	health
When bureaucrats talk about increasing our 'access' to x, y or z, what they're really talking about is increasing exponentially their control over our lives. As it is with the government health care takeover, so it is with the newly approved government plan to 'increase' Internet 'access.'	Michelle Malkin	health
For the past two years, President Obama has promised our children the moon, stars, rainbows, unicorns and universal health care for all. But the White House Santa's cradle-to-grave entitlement mandates are a spectacularly predictable bust.	Michelle Malkin	health
If Obama wanted to make radical changes to America's health long-term, all he has to do is treble the price of sugar and salt.	Jamie Oliver	health
I admit it: I had fun watching right-wingers go wild as health reform finally became law.	Paul Krugman	health
I am in very good health. I've never felt better.	Hugh Hefner	health
If your access to health care involves your leaving work and driving somewhere and parking and waiting for a long time, that's not going to promote healthiness.	Larry Page	health
The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew and act anew.	Abraham Lincoln	history
The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much it is whether we provide enough for those who have little.	Franklin D. Roosevelt	history

Glory is fleeting, but obscurity is forever.	Napoleon Bonaparte	history

Hence poetry is something more philosophic and of graver import than history, since its statements are rather of the nature of universals, whereas those of history are singulars.	Aristotle	history
In the course of history, men come to see that iron necessity is neither iron nor necessary.	Friedrich Nietzsche	history
History is a set of lies agreed upon.	Napoleon Bonaparte	history

Europe was created by history. America was created by philosophy.	Margaret Thatcher	history
I want to reform the tax code so that it's simple, fair, and asks the wealthiest households to pay higher taxes on incomes over $250,000 - the same rate we had when Bill Clinton was president the same rate we had when our economy created nearly 23 million new jobs, the biggest surplus in history, and a lot of millionaires to boot.	Barack Obama	history
If past history was all there was to the game, the richest people would be librarians.	Warren Buffett	history

We've persevered because of a belief we share with the Iraqi people - a belief that out of the ashes of war, a new beginning could be born in this cradle of civilization. Through this remarkable chapter in the history of the United States and Iraq, we have met our responsibility. Now, it's time to turn the page.	Barack Obama	history
I would put our legislative and foreign policy accomplishments in our first two years against any president - with the possible exceptions of Johnson, FDR, and Lincoln - just in terms of what we've gotten done in modern history. But, you know, but when it comes to the economy, we've got a lot more work to do. And we're gonna keep on at it.	Barack Obama	history
Indeed, history is nothing more than a tableau of crimes and misfortunes.	Voltaire	history
History should be written as philosophy.	Voltaire	history
President Barack Obama has stood watch over the greatest job loss in modern American history. And that, my friends, is one inconvenient truth that will haunt this President throughout history.	Mitt Romney	history

Hillary Clinton	history

Things have never been more like the way they are today in history.	Dwight D. Eisenhower	history
Our nation was created in ways that allow human potential to prosper, and it created the greatest nation for people in the history of humanity.

In its history, Europe has committed so many massacres and horrors that it should bow its own head in shame.	Desmond Tutu	history
'WASP' is the only ethnic term that is in fact a term of class, apart from redneck, which is another word for the same group but who are in the lower social strata, so it's inexplicably tied up with social standing and culture and history in a way that the other hyphenations just are not.	Christopher Hitchens	history
The principle that human nature, in its psychological aspects, is nothing more than a product of history and given social relations removes all barriers to coercion and manipulation by the powerful.	Noam Chomsky	history

The Carter Center has the only existing international taskforce on disease eradication. Which means a total elimination of a disease on the face of the Earth.

I really like to look like a history book. I can look 1940s, I can look 1970s hippie-chic, or sometimes I'll pull that '80s Brooklyn hip-hop kid with the door-knocker earrings.	Katy Perry	history
The advantages found in history seem to be of three kinds, as it amuses the fancy, as it improves the understanding, and as it strengthens virtue.	David Hume	history

I want to write a book which is the history of comedy.	John Cleese	history

And they want to repeal it.	Joe Biden	history
There's a lot of revisionist history that goes on these days about Iraq.	Joe Biden	history
I graduated from the University of Delaware with a double major in history and political science.	Joe Biden	history
Whatever can be noted historically can be found within history.	Martin Heidegger	history
If you take a look at history, you will find that the understanding of what is good and evil has always existed before the individual religions. The religions were only invented by people afterwards, in order to express this idea.	Salman Rushdie	history
The subject matter is very tricky. It's about the Munich massacre and what Mossad did afterwards with the assassination squads. I think it's a turning point in history, especially for the Palestinians.	Daniel Craig	history
It's a huge challenge, a huge responsibility. Bond is a huge iconic figure in movie history. These opportunities don't come along very often so I thought, 'Why not?'	Daniel Craig	history
In this world without quiet corners, there can be no easy escapes from history, from hullabaloo, from terrible, unquiet fuss.	Salman Rushdie	history
There is a widespread difficulty in the Muslim world, which has to do with how the people are taught about examining their own history. A whole range of stuff has been placed off limits.	Salman Rushdie	history
I don't see women and think of them as competition or with judgment. Women really move me. I feel connected to all kinds of women. I am angry because I think we've been mistreated throughout history in different countries, including America. I admire women.	Salma Hayek	history
Anybody who comes to the cinema is bringing they're whole sexual history, their literary history, their movie literacy, their culture, their language, their religion, whatever they've got. I can't possibly manipulate all of that, nor do I want to.	David Cronenberg	history

When President Obama entered the White House, the economy was in a free-fall. The auto industry: on its back. The banks: frozen up. More than three million Americans had already lost their jobs. And America's bravest, our men and women in uniform, were fighting what would soon be the longest wars in our history.	Rahm Emanuel	history
In terms of the history of a far reaching movement, 20 years is not that long.	Aung San Suu Kyi	history
History is always changing.	Aung San Suu Kyi	history
I realise that I do not change the course of history. I am an actor, I do a movie, that's the end of it. You have to realise we are just clowns for hire. After I had success it was great, at first, not to worry about money. It was on my mind when I was growing up.	Leonardo DiCaprio	history
From lies to forgeries the step is not so long, and I have written technical essays on the logic of forgeries and on the influence of forgeries on history.	Umberto Eco	history
The president led us into the Iraq war on the basis of unproven assertions without evidence he embraced a radical doctrine of pre-emptive war unprecedented in our history and he failed to build a true international coalition.	Nancy Pelosi	history
The American people voted to restore integrity and honesty in Washington, D.C., and the Democrats intend to lead the most honest, most open and most ethical Congress in history.	Nancy Pelosi	history

I don't want to go negative on Franklin Delano Roosevelt, but he didn't pass an economic deal in the first 100 days. We have passed the largest Recovery Act in the history of the country.	Rahm Emanuel	history
I know every note in every song, the whole history of it, even parts that were there and are gone.	Enya	history
We've been a country that's been fortunate to be protected by two oceans, to not have serious attacks on our territory for most of our history. And we were unfortunately reminded in a very devastating way of our vulnerability.	Condoleezza Rice	history
If we got into a situation where people start burning our records, then bring it on. That's the whole point. The gloaming has begun. We're in the darkness. This has happened before. Go read some history.	Thom Yorke	history

There is nothing like staying at home for real comfort.	Jane Austen	home
I'm the type who'd be happy not going anywhere as long as I was sure I knew exactly what was happening at the places I wasn't going to. I'm the type who'd like to sit home and watch every party that I'm invited to on a monitor in my bedroom.	Andy Warhol	home
In our home there was always prayer - aloud, proud and unapologetic.	Lyndon B. Johnson	home
Love begins at home, and it is not how much we do... but how much love we put in that action.	Mother Teresa	home

Let the wife make the husband glad to come home, and let him make her sorry to see him leave.	Martin Luther	home
If my world were to cave in tomorrow, I would look back on all the pleasures, excitements and worthwhilenesses I have been lucky enough to have had. Not the sadness, not my miscarriages or my father leaving home, but the joy of everything else. It will have been enough.	Audrey Hepburn	home
Say there's a white kid who lives in a nice home, goes to an all-white school, and is pretty much having everything handed to him on a platter - for him to pick up a rap tape is incredible to me, because what that's saying is that he's living a fantasy life of rebellion.	Eminem	home
It's silly talking about how many years we will have to spend in the jungles of Vietnam when we could pave the whole country and put parking stripes on it and still be home by Christmas.	Ronald Reagan	home
We should declare war on North Vietnam. We could pave the whole country and put parking strips on it, and still be home by Christmas.	Ronald Reagan	home
There is just no comparison between having a dinner date with a man and staying home playing canasta with the girls.	Marilyn Monroe	home
I didn't have nothin' going for me... school, home... until I found something I loved, which was music, and that changed everything.	Eminem	home
An artist has no home in Europe except in Paris.	Friedrich Nietzsche	home

So long as I'm Commander-in-Chief, we will sustain the strongest military the world has ever known. When you take off the uniform, we will serve you as well as you've served us - because no one who fights for this country should have to fight for a job, or a roof over their head, or the care that they need when they come home.	Barack Obama	home
The most compelling reason for most people to buy a computer for the home will be to link it to a nationwide communications network. We're just in the beginning stages of what will be a truly remarkable breakthrough for most people - as remarkable as the telephone.	Steve Jobs	home
My home is in Heaven. I'm just traveling through this world.	Billy Graham	home
Nothing can bring a real sense of security into the home except true love.	Billy Graham	home
My father probably thought the capital of the world was wherever he was at the time. It couldn't possibly be anyplace else. Where he and his wife were in their own home, that, for them, was the capital of the world.	Bob Dylan	home
The land created me. I'm wild and lonesome. Even as I travel the cities, I'm more at home in the vacant lots.	Bob Dylan	home

Today's misery is real unemployment, home foreclosures and bankruptcies. This is the Obama Misery Index and its at a record high. Its going to take more than new rhetoric to put Americans back to work - its going to take a new president.	Mitt Romney	home
I think a submarine is a very worthwhile weapon. I believe we can defend ourselves with submarines and all our troops back at home. This whole idea that we have to be in 130 countries and 900 bases... is an old-fashioned idea.	Ron Paul	home
For those who have come here illegally, they might have a transition time to allow them to set their affairs in order. And then go back home and get in line with everybody else. And if they get in line and they apply to become a citizen and get a green card, they will be treated like everybody else.	Mitt Romney	home
We all have times when we go home at night and pull out our hair and feel misunderstood and lonely and like we're falling. I think the brain is such that there is always going to be something missing.	Jude Law	home
It's passionately interesting for me that the things that I learned in a small town, in a very modest home, are just the things that I believe have won the election.	Margaret Thatcher	home

The means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home.	James Madison	home
As much as I would love to be a person that goes to parties and has a couple of drinks and has a nice time, that doesn't work for me. I'd just rather sit at home and read, or go out to dinner with someone, or talk to someone I love, or talk to somebody that makes me laugh.	Daniel Radcliffe	home
I have Social Disease. I have to go out every night. If I stay home one night I start spreading rumors to my dogs.	Andy Warhol	home

And I come here as a daughter, raised on the South Side of Chicago - by a father who was a blue-collar city worker and a mother who stayed at home with my brother and me.	Michelle Obama	home
And when the day arrives I'll become the sky and I'll become the sea and the sea will come to kiss me for I am going home. Nothing can stop me now.	Trent Reznor	home
Perhaps it is a universal truth that the loss of liberty at home is to be charged to provisions against danger, real or pretended, from abroad.	James Madison	home
Things aren't right. If a burglar breaks into your home and you shoot him, he can sue you. For what, restraint of trade?	Bill Maher	home
Always there has been some terrible evil at home or some monstrous foreign power that was going to gobble us up if we did not blindly rally behind it.	Douglas MacArthur	home
I've always thought my soundtracks do pretty good, because they're basically professional equivalents of a mix tape I'd make for you at home.	Quentin Tarantino	home
I was coming home from kindergarten - well they told me it was kindergarten. I found out later I had been working in a factory for ten years. It's good for a kid to know how to make gloves.	Ellen DeGeneres	home
The perfect date for me would be staying at home, making a big picnic in bed, eating Wotsits and cookies while watching cable TV.	Kim Kardashian	home
We have two dogs, Mabel and Wolf, and three cats at home, Charlie, George and Chairman. We have two cats on our farm, Tom and Little Sister, two horses, and two mini horses, Hannah and Tricky. We also have two cows, Holy and Madonna. And those are only the animals we let sleep in our bed.	Ellen DeGeneres	home
When I come home, my daughter will run to the door and give me a big hug, and everything that's happened that day just melts away.	Hugh Jackman	home
My mother never gave up one me. I messed up in school so much they were sending me home, but my mother sent me right back.	Denzel Washington	home
Students never think it can be the teacher's fault and so I thought I was stupid. I was frustrated and would come home and cry because I couldn't do it. Then we got a new teacher who made math accessible. That made all the difference and I learned that it's how you present it that makes it scary or friendly.	Danica McKellar	home
England is my home. London is my home. New York feels like, if I have to spend a year living in an unfamiliar city, this is a pretty lovely one to spend a year in, but I will be going home at the end of it, certainly.	Daniel Radcliffe	home
Yes, I've kissed a lot of guys. I like to kiss, but that's it. I don't go home with anyone. I sleep with my animals, like my baby monkey, Brigitte Bardot.	Paris Hilton	home
Why would I retire? Sit at home and watch TV? No thanks. I'd rather be out playing.	Paul McCartney	home
Since the departure of good old-fashioned entertainers the re-emergence of somebody who wants to be an entertainer has unfortunately become a synonym for camp. I don't think I'm camper than any other person who felt at home on stage, and felt more at home on stage than he did offstage.	David Bowie	home
I was making a lot of 8mm home movies, since I was twelve, making little dramas and comedies with the neighborhood kids.	Steven Spielberg	home
I report to you that our country is challenged at home and abroad: that it is our will that is being tried and not our strength our sense of purpose and not our ability to achieve a better America.	Lyndon B. Johnson	home
The penalty for getting mugged in an American city and losing your ID is that you can't fly home.	Christopher Hitchens	home

Producing is so exciting because you can enable things to happen, whether it's like discovering a filmmaker who you're taking a chance on, protecting a battle and driving home at the end of the day just going, 'I'm so glad I stayed late at work and fought hard for that. Had my passion. Won that battle.'	Drew Barrymore	home
I couldn't care less about fashion. If I had taken any clothes home, they would have remained in my closet for the rest of their existence.	Meryl Streep	home

I love coming home to somebody, I love being in a relationship.	Daniel Radcliffe	home
When you do take the home pregnancy test, it doesn't quite seem real. But when you see the baby and the heartbeat on the ultrasound, it's so incredible.	Danica McKellar	home

One of the great privileges of having grown up in a middle-class literary English household, but having gone to school in the front lines in Southeast London, was that I became half-street-urchin and half-good-boy at home. I knew that dichotomy was possible.	Daniel Day-Lewis	home
Because of my parents' love of democracy, we came to America after being driven twice from our home in Czechoslovakia - first by Hitler and then by Stalin.	Madeleine Albright	home

Sub-Saharan Africa is also home to 400 million of the world's poorest people.	Bono	home
I actually do think you're seeing this trend towards organizations just caring more about their brand and engaging. And so I think Home Depot will want to humanize itself. I think that's a lot of why companies are starting blogs, are just giving more insight into what's going on with them.	Mark Zuckerberg	home
I want to go home at night and feel discomfort.	Nicole Kidman	home
I'm actually graduating early. I got a lot of work done already. Being home schooled, I have had a lot of tutors help me.	Miley Cyrus	home
I came here in 1974 to do a play, and then I went to L.A. I really like living in America. I feel more at home here than anywhere else.	Anthony Hopkins	home
In the theatre, people talk. Talk, talk until the cows come home about journeys of discovery and about what Hazlitt thought of a line of Shakespeare. I can't stand it.	Anthony Hopkins	home
Sleep more at night. If it's allowed at work or home, take a nap in the afternoon. You'll be amazed at how much better you'll feel.	Ben Stein	home
Most of the time I liked school and got good grades. In junior high, though, I hit a stumbling block with math - I used to come home and cry because of how frustrated I was! But after a few good teachers and a lot of perseverance, I ended up loving math and even choosing it as a major when I got to college.	Danica McKellar	home
I exercise at home - light cardio and yoga.	Danica McKellar	home
Here at home, when Americans were standing in long lines to give blood after the attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, we squandered an obvious opportunity to make service a noble cause again, and rekindle an American spirit of community.	Joe Biden	home
I was kind of secretly hoping one of my kids would go out and make a million bucks. So when they put me in a home, at least I'll have a window with a view.	Joe Biden	home
Atlanta's my musical home. It really was the place where I really came alive.	John Mayer	home
Every song I put on a record could be a single and I just pack my bags for it... and the minute it takes off, I'm not gonna be home for a while.	John Mayer	home
What I've learned in my life, it's a very interesting social study for me, to go back and forth between being the guy at home and being the guy on the road and being the guy in studio and being the guy in the interview. The environment around you has so much to do with your character, and when I'm home, my character really changes quite a bit.	John Mayer	home
For my wrap present, Colin Farrell gave me a first edition book. I got so involved with this character and I was so sad when the movie was over that when I got home and I tried to read the book I got really emotional and I started crying.	Salma Hayek	home
Yes, Americans can still get credit for cars and trucks and refrigerators, and those businesses are doing well. But just try to get a home loan now.	Ben Stein	home
All I was doing was trying to get home from work.	Rosa Parks	home
I'm still a kid. I'm like six years old. But it's just a matter of wanting to get up, it's just a big journey. I felt like when I left home that I was on a journey, and I still am.	Heath Ledger	home
I was gutted to leave my boyfriend at home when I started my tour, but taking my pillow was like taking a little bit of him with me.	Amy Winehouse	home
A fan sent me a letter and a $10 bill. It's a short letter - all she said was, 'Hey, since it's harder for you to go out these days without getting photographed, here $10 for a pizza.' I was like, 'Aww, she sent me money for a pizza so I could eat at home!'	Zac Efron	home
There is not a lot of separation between work and home life.	Cate Blanchett	home
It's simple: You get a part. You play a part. You play it well. You do your work and you go home. And what is wonderful about movies is that once they're done, they belong to the people. Once you make it, it's what they see. That's where my head is at.	Denzel Washington	home
It's a miracle was the last track recorded for the album, we based it on the rhythm from the middle of 'Late Home Tonight, where there's Graham Broad playing lots and lots of drums with me shouting in the background, pretending to be a mad Arab leader.	Roger Waters	home
The best thing for me is, when I'm not working, is to be at home and to have a script or two scripts is better, and to be just walking around the house and just thinking about the lines.	Christopher Walken	home
Having been let out of the barn once, I know I wouldn't be happy if I were home all the time.	Meryl Streep	home
You make movies for the people. If critics happen to like them too, well, that's a home run.	Vin Diesel	home
I have a five year-old son and a three year-old daughter. I want my son to have a choice to contribute fully in the workforce or at home. And I want my daughter to have the choice to not just succeed, but to be liked for her accomplishments.	Sheryl Sandberg	home
Don't get me wrong - I've gone to a club. But I'd much rather be with my close friends at home or a concert, or on a trip. I'll go dancing with my grandma. She likes to cut a rug!	Zac Efron	home
I hit the ground running, without a lot of training, so I had to do whatever I could do to survive as a professional, and if that meant being that character 24/7 and acting out, I was going to do that. I lived those characters, I brought them home with me.	Nicolas Cage	home
I bought a Yamaha-1 and I was doing 180 miles per hour home on the 405 and that's really, really crazy but I did it.	Nicolas Cage	home
Believe me, you can get into a lot of trouble being sixteen years old in a foreign country with no adult telling you when to come home.	Cameron Diaz	home
When my mother got home from work, she would take me to the movies. It was her way of getting out, and she would take me with her. I'd go home and act all the parts. It had a tremendous influence on my becoming an actor.	Al Pacino	home
When I was doing 'Scarface,' I remember being in love at that time. One of the few times in my life. And I was so glad it was at that time. I would come home and she would tell me about her life that day and all her problems and I remember saying to her, look, you really got me through this picture because I would shed everything when I came home.	Al Pacino	home
You're always tellin' me to go out more, Go ahead, get out and see the world, But then I think, why should I? I'd rather stay home and cry.	Gwen Stefani	home
The killer app that got the world ready for appliances was the light bulb. So the light bulb is what wired the world. And they weren't thinking about appliances when they wired the world. They were really thinking about - they weren't putting electricity into the home. They were putting lighting into the home.	Jeff Bezos	home
The one thing that offends me the most is when I walk by a bank and see ads trying to convince people to take out second mortgages on their home so they can go on vacation. That's approaching evil.	Jeff Bezos	home
The relevance for 9/11 is that what 9/11 marked was the beginning of a struggle in which the terrorists come at us and strike us here on our home territory. And it's a global operation. It doesn't know national boundaries or national borders.	Dick Cheney	home
I remember when I came home from the hospital after having my son, I wore a Narciso Rodriguez black coat. Then, I was using this fragrance that I had created. I walk by that coat, and it still smells like that fragrance. It takes you right there.	Sarah Jessica Parker	home
And I came back and it was great, 'cuz George had set up all these flowers all over the studio saying welcome home. So then we got it together again. I always felt it was better on the White one for me. We were more like a band, you know.	Ringo Starr	home
From the moment this baby came into our home, those two dogs have never been more in love. It's the most beautiful thing I've ever witnessed. People keep saying, 'Oh, you're a single mom.' I'm like, 'Actually, I'm not. I've got two boys helping.'	Charlize Theron	home
I saw the president make the tough calls in the Situation Room - and today, our troops in Iraq have finally come home so America can do some nation building here at home. That was the change that we believed in. That was the change we fought for. That was the change President Obama delivered.	Rahm Emanuel	home
The aesthetic came along the way, I think - just through experimenting, and going on tour, and trying stuff out on stage, having fun with it, and not taking it too seriously. If I had a ballgown at home, I'd wear it onstage. If I found something in a charity shop, I'd wear it. That's where it grew from - just wanting to play dress-up.	Florence Welch	home
Mr. Bean is at his best when he is not using words, but I am equally at home in both verbal and nonverbal expression.	Rowan Atkinson	home
Confronting a stadium audience, you can't see the whites of their eyes. It's just an amorphous mass of noise and, of course, you can't see the alleged billions watching at home either, so the degree to which you are intimidated is quite low.	Rowan Atkinson	home
I grew up in a home environment where I wasn't getting esteem for anything I did.	Ben Affleck	home
I'm still really close with everyone at home and their parents - and their brothers and sisters. I was so, so, so lucky to grow up as part of a community and I don't take that for granted. I try very hard to stay part of it.	Jennifer Garner	home
And now, I still really don't care that much but now I have music playing all the time at home, which is a first for me. Whatever. Everything from Ani DiFranco to Dave Matthews to Jack Johnson and Norah Jones.	Jennifer Garner	home
There's an internal battle. I need to work, I need to work, I need to work and I need to be home with my kids and the kids win.	Jennifer Garner	home
My sisters both are working mothers. I understand that my being an actress as well as being at home isn't some heroic thing. That doesn't mean it isn't confusing or difficult - especially that question of how you find a balance.	Jennifer Garner	home
No, let's make sure that people understand that this is a very important war that is helping to protect us here at home. And that we have no choice but to win it. As difficult as it is.	John Boehner	home
Every woman I've had a relationship with has found this maddening the fact that I will talk about anything on the stage, and reveal all this stuff, and yet when I'm at home, I clam up and won't discuss anything intimate or personal.	Jarvis Cocker	home
I have two homes in Malibu, a home in Canada that I'm building, and I just love pouring my heart out into this part of my life.	Pamela Anderson	home

But, yeah, I'm really happy when I'm writing. When I'm being creative and when I have something that I can put down. You know, if you go out and you overhear a conversation or you have a thought, you have a receptacle to go home and say, 'Oh, this would be great in this script.' Your antenna's out in a different way, and I love that time.	Josh Radnor	home
I fantasize about having a manual job where I can come home at night, read a book and not feel responsible for what will happen the next day.	Jodie Foster	home

When I die, I hope to go to Heaven, whatever the Hell that is.	Ayn Rand	hope
I've tried to reduce profanity but I reduced so much profanity when writing the book that I'm afraid not much could come out. Perhaps we will have to consider it simply as a profane book and hope that the next book will be less profane or perhaps more sacred.	Ernest Hemingway	hope
You are not here merely to make a living. You are here in order to enable the world to live more amply, with greater vision, with a finer spirit of hope and achievement. You are here to enrich the world, and you impoverish yourself if you forget the errand.	Woodrow Wilson	hope
Together we will build an America where hope is a new job with a paycheck, not a faded word on an old bumper sticker.	Mitt Romney	hope

How wonderful that we have met with a paradox. Now we have some hope of making progress.	Niels Bohr	hope
I'm not the type of guy who enjoys one-night stands. It leaves me feeling very empty and cynical. It's not even fun sexually. I need to feel something for the woman and entertain the vain hope that it may lead to a relationship.	Ben Affleck	hope

The cause of my life has been to oppose superstition. It's a battle you can't hope to win - it's a battle that's going to go on forever. It's part of the human condition.	Christopher Hitchens	hope
What can I know? What ought I to do? What can I hope?	Immanuel Kant	hope

Acting is something I love. It's a great craft that I have a lot of respect for. But I don't think it's any greater challenge than teaching 8-year-olds or any other career. In my life, I try not to make it more important than it is and I just hope that rubs off on the people around me.	Hugh Jackman	hope
The media tried to destroy my parents and has taken things completely out of context, but there's not a whole lot you can do in terms of fighting back. You have to hope that it passes, which it always does. But they have to be careful. They didn't necessarily sign up for this.	Katy Perry	hope
One thing I can't do, and I hope that there are other people out there that feel the same way, is climb a rope. Oh my gosh, it's so hard to climb rope! It's all about grip and arms.	Katy Perry	hope

I hope that as the Senate and American people learn more about me, they will see that I am an ordinary person who has been blessed with extraordinary opportunities and experiences.	Sonia Sotomayor	hope
When you put something out there into the world, there's all these words you don't want to hear, that you hope people don't say. I don't like anything that starts with 're' - like retro, reinvent, recreate - I hate that. It's always like living in the past - copying, emulating.	Jack White	hope
If the character is true, the movie will fall into place. Or at least that's what you hope.	Ryan Gosling	hope
For now, I'm just going to keep doing the work and hope I don't get fired. If people want to put me up on their walls, I'll love it.	Ryan Gosling	hope
They have a kind of Bob Hope and Bing Crosby thing going on.	Christopher Walken	hope
My hope is that people will be repulsed by the character's complete lack of ethics and obsession with consumerism - that's what I was saying about the difference between the character's message and the film's message.	Christian Bale	hope
Most people like to read about intrigue and spies. I hope to provide a metaphor for the average reader's daily life. Most of us live in a slightly conspiratorial relationship with our employer and perhaps with our marriage.	John le Carre	hope
For a person who promised hope and civility in politics, Mr. Obama has shown a borderline obsessiveness in blaming Mr. Bush.	Karl Rove	hope
My hope is that I will take the good from my experiences and extrapolate them further into areas with which I am unfamiliar. I simply do not know exactly what that difference will be in my judging. But I accept there will be some based on my gender and my Latina heritage.	Sonia Sotomayor	hope
You never know what movie I will be in next, but let's just hope it's sells (for my sake at least)!	Cameron Diaz	hope
I think by now I have made it fairly clear that I am not very happy with the word hope. I don't believe in people just hoping.	Aung San Suu Kyi	hope
The other day I got a text from a boy, but it wasn't hot. I mean, if you're going to text me every day, you haven't seen me for months and you're trying to seduce me, you'd better spice up that text and make it more exciting than 'How was your day? I hope you're having a beautiful one.' Sadly, I haven't been doing a lot of kissing lately.	Chloe Sevigny	hope
I have learned from my experiences in this industry that there is absolutely no way to control people's opinions on your performance in your movie. You go out there, promote your film and hope people like the work you did.	Leonardo DiCaprio	hope

House and Senate Republicans are now united in adopting earmark bans. We hope President Obama will follow through on his support for an earmark ban by pressing Democratic leaders to join House and Senate Republicans in taking this critical step to restore public trust.	John Boehner	hope
I love the Beatles. I haven't named any kids after them but I still really love them. They were the first group that I was ever properly aware of. In my early teens I would sometimes stay in and listen to the radio all day in the hope that I would catch a song by them that I'd never heard before and be able to tape it on my radio-cassette player.	Jarvis Cocker	hope
I am proud, and more than a little excited, to be asked to work with Faber in an editorial capacity. It is my dearest hope that we will produce some fantastic books together.	Jarvis Cocker	hope

Well, I've been reading a lot about the fifty years since the Second World War, about Western foreign policy and all that. I try not to let it get to me, but sometimes I just think that there's no hope.	Thom Yorke	hope
Like all parents, my husband and I just do the best we can, hold our breath and hope we've set aside enough money for our kid's therapy.	Michelle Pfeiffer	hope
I'm moving on. I should have made that clear when I made the announcement. I guess I wasn't clear. If people think you're leaving a show after all these years, you might be retiring. So I understand where they're coming from, but I should have impressed the fact that I hope I'm just moving on right now.	Regis Philbin	hope
I would hope everyone would be a feminist.	Mia Wasikowska	hope
As a young actor, people were trying to define who I was before I really knew that for myself. But I still remember thinking, 'This is what I love doing, and I hope I'm going to be able to do it forever.'	Tom Cruise	hope
Yes, well I really hope I can make a difference, even in the smallest way. I am looking forward to helping as much as I can.	Kate Middleton	hope
You travel with the hope that something unexpected will happen. It has to do with enjoying being lost and figuring it out and the satisfaction. I always get a little disappointed when I know too well where I'm going, or when I've lived in a place so long that there's no chance I could possibly get lost.	Andrew Bird	hope

Humor is not a mood but a way of looking at the world. So if it is correct to say that humor was stamped out in Nazi Germany, that does not mean that people were not in good spirits, or anything of that sort, but something much deeper and more important.	Ludwig Wittgenstein	humor

The comic is the perception of the opposite humor is the feeling of it.	Umberto Eco	humor
I've never met a person who has more integrity than my husband. I respect that. There's his humor and intelligence, too, and he's really cute, all those things - but if you don't respect your partner, you'll get sick of him.	Michelle Pfeiffer	humor
There was a time I was very much blaming the way I felt on L.A, that it was a vacuum of creativity, of humor or anything organic, and I was really angry at the place. But then today I feel completely different - I love L.A.!	Naomi Watts	humor
I'm interested not just in projects that I'll be starring in, but producing film and TV that's really quality and great for adults and when I say 'great for adults,' it doesn't mean without humor, because I'm also interested in doing comedy.	Lance Reddick	humor

I used to make up stuff in my bio all the time, that I used to be a professional ice-skater and stuff like that. I found it so inspirational. Why not make myself cooler than I am?	Stephen Colbert	inspirational

Bottom line is, I didn't return to Apple to make a fortune. I've been very lucky in my life and already have one. When I was 25, my net worth was $100 million or so. I decided then that I wasn't going to let it ruin my life. There's no way you could ever spend it all, and I don't view wealth as something that validates my intelligence.	Steve Jobs	intelligence
Everything in the universe has a purpose. Indeed, the invisible intelligence that flows through everything in a purposeful fashion is also flowing through you.	Wayne Dyer	intelligence

Intelligence agencies keep things secret because they often violate the rule of law or of good behavior.	Julian Assange	intelligence
It's part of a writer's profession, as it's part of a spy's profession, to prey on the community to which he's attached, to take away information - often in secret - and to translate that into intelligence for his masters, whether it's his readership or his spy masters. And I think that both professions are perhaps rather lonely.	John le Carre	intelligence
Bill Gates wants people to think he's Edison, when he's really Rockefeller. Referring to Gates as the smartest man in America isn't right... wealth isn't the same thing as intelligence.	Larry Ellison	intelligence
But once you are in that field, emotional intelligence emerges as a much stronger predictor of who will be most successful, because it is how we handle ourselves in our relationships that determines how well we do once we are in a given job.	Daniel Goleman	intelligence

Whoever undertakes to set himself up as a judge of Truth and Knowledge is shipwrecked by the laughter of the gods.	Albert Einstein	knowledge

When we go to the Bible we should keep in mind that the basic principles of the Bible are taught by God, but written down by human beings deprived of modern day knowledge.

But I do not believe that the world would be entirely different if there were more women leaders. Maybe if everybody in leadership was a woman, you might not get into the conflicts in the first place. But if you watch the women who have made it to the top, they haven't exactly been non-aggressive - including me.	Madeleine Albright	leadership
Maybe if everybody in leadership was a woman, you might not get into the conflicts in the first place. But if you watch the women who have made it to the top, they haven't exactly been non-aggressive - including me.	Madeleine Albright	leadership

To know oneself is to study oneself in action with another person.	Bruce Lee	learning

We are never so defensless against suffering as when we love.	Sigmund Freud	love
All women have a perception much more developed than men. So all women somehow, being repressed for so many millennia, they ended up by developing this sixth sense and contemplation and love. And this is something that we have a hard time to accept as part of our society.	Paulo Coelho	love

Whoever loves becomes humble. Those who love have, so to speak, pawned a part of their narcissism.	Sigmund Freud	love

It is not the creation of wealth that is wrong, but the love of money for its own sake.	Margaret Thatcher	love

I don't know if I believe in love at first sight, but of course I believe in two people having chemistry right away. A girl should be really easy to talk to. When I lose track of time because we've been talking, I think that's really fun.	Zac Efron	love
Everything that I love is behind those gates. We have elephants, and giraffes, and crocodiles, and every kind of tigers and lions. And - and we have bus loads of kids, who don't get to see those things. They come up sick children, and enjoy it.	Michael Jackson	love
Only the really plain people know about love - the very fascinating ones try so hard to create an impression that they soon exhaust their talents.	Katharine Hepburn	love

If we're destroying our trees and destroying our environment and hurting animals and hurting one another and all that stuff, there's got to be a very powerful energy to fight that.

People love westerns worldwide. There's something fantasy-like about an individual fighting the elements. Or even bad guys and the elements. It's a simpler time. There's no organized laws and stuff.	Clint Eastwood	love

I'm getting a wrinkle above my eyebrow because I just can't stop lifting it, and I love that you know.	Angelina Jolie	love

There is hardly any activity, any enterprise, which is started out with such tremendous hopes and expectations, and yet which fails so regularly, as love.	Erich Fromm	love

Love is often nothing but a favorable exchange between two people who get the most of what they can expect, considering their value on the personality market.	Erich Fromm	love
When you're taught to love everyone, to love your enemies, then what value does that place on love?	Marilyn Manson	love

At the end of the day, you know, love does not happen between two perfect people as much as we would wish.	Hillary Clinton	love

There were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded.	Princess Diana	marriage

I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am not in favor of gay marriage.

Usually, our constitutions expand liberties, they don't contract them.	Barack Obama	marriage

Barack Obama	marriage
I think that gay marriage should be between a man and a woman.	Arnold Schwarzenegger	marriage

Marriage changes everything.	Marilyn Manson	marriage

I'll always be sad that my marriage ended.	Shania Twain	marriage
I never had a policy about marriage. I got married very young in life and I always think in all relationships, I've always thought that it's counterproductive to have a theory on that.	Jack Nicholson	marriage
Marriage is this grand madness, and I think if people knew that, they would perhaps take it more seriously.	Bono	marriage

I'm not convinced about marriage. Divorce is so easy, and that fact that gay people are not allowed to marry takes much of the meaning out of it. Committing yourself to one person is sacred.	Natalie Portman	marriage

Now I'm a wife and a mother of two. It's a really different role. I always referred to No Doubt as a marriage, because that's what it's like to be together for so long and go through what we've been through. I can't really have that relationship with them anymore.	Gwen Stefani	marriage

The rule with marriage is the less you talk about it the better, as far as I can tell.	Jennifer Garner	marriage

I'm always told that what I say is controversial. Why is it controversial? Because I speak from a tradition that has now fallen out of favor with the dominant media in this country.

Any sex outside of the marriage bond between a man and a woman is violating God's law.	Jerry Falwell	marriage

I also think it was important for me and Freddie to be able to have a lot of time to share our lives at the beginning of our marriage rather than my coming home at 9 or 10 at night from the set. Things have really worked out for the best for both of us.	Sarah Michelle Gellar	marriage
Ultimately, I believe the only secret to a happy marriage is choosing the right person. Life is a series of choices, right?	Michelle Pfeiffer	marriage
Isn't that the ultimate homeland security, standing up and defending marriage?	Rick Santorum	marriage

I think gay marriage should be the national law.	Rose McGowan	marriage
They make Spy Kids, they make Scream, they make A Scary Movie. This doesn't do that, so it could be a very bad marriage. I'm trying to keep this potential nightmare quiet because we're just finishing editing.	Terry Gilliam	marriage

You don't get hung up on zeros.	Jack Welch	medical

Megan Fox	men

I think my mom threatened to put me up for adoption a few times.	Ivanka Trump	mom

It's hard to tell with these Internet startups if they're really interested in building companies or if they're just interested in the money.

I don't want to make money I want to make a difference.	Lady Gaga	money
Look, I'm very much in favor of tax cuts, but not with borrowed money. And the problem that we've gotten into in recent years is spending programs with borrowed money, tax cuts with borrowed money, and at the end of the day that proves disastrous. And my view is I don't think we can play subtle policy here.	Alan Greenspan	money
I decided to pursue music, so I dropped out of school and I told my parents I didn't want any money from them. I got three jobs and I just hit the ground running.	Lady Gaga	money
A lot of people in the media, and some everyday people, really aren't in search of the truth. They're in search of something worse than that. Money, yeah. I think the media's the kind of a thing where the truth doesn't win, because it's no fun. The truth's no fun.	Jack White	money
Clearly this is a tough economic time, and a lot of families are hurting. So when we talk to parents, we talk about small changes for kids and things that don't cost extra money. Like adding water and eliminating sugary drinks and sodas. That's going to save money right there. Or adding a few more vegetables.	Michelle Obama	money
The idea that a congressman would be tainted by accepting money from private industry or private sources is essentially a socialist argument.	Newt Gingrich	money
Congress, the press, and the bureaucracy too often focus on how much money or effort is spent, rather than whether the money or effort actually achieves the announced goal.	Donald Rumsfeld	money
Of course, I do everything for money.	Christopher Hitchens	money
Money is the seed of money, and the first guinea is sometimes more difficult to acquire than the second million.	Jean-Jacques Rousseau	money
Some artists are working to buy the mansion or whatever the element of fame must bear, but I spend all my money on my show.	Lady Gaga	money
I don't care about money.	Lady Gaga	money
I definitely spend the most money on shoes, partly because vintage footwear can be a little funky - in a bad way. I like to keep things pretty simple up top and then go weird with the shoes.	Chloe Sevigny	money
I'm free of stress and worries now because if I don't like something I'm doing, I just find the fun in it instead of being miserable. Let me have fun with the people I work with, let me have fun making money - when I grew up so poor, ya know?	Jenny McCarthy	money
This is our commitment to users and the people who use our service, is that Facebook's a free service. It's free now. It will always be free. We make money through having advertisements and things like that.	Mark Zuckerberg	money
A development deal is where they're giving you recording time and money to record, but not promising that they'll put an album out.	Taylor Swift	money
Labor was the first price, the original purchase - money that was paid for all things.	Adam Smith	money
Money and fame made me believe I was entitled. I was wrong and foolish.	Tiger Woods	money
I felt that I had worked hard my entire life and deserved to enjoy all the temptations around me. I felt I was entitled, and thanks to money and fame, I didn't have to go far to find them.	Tiger Woods	money
We are going as fast as we can as soon as we can. We're in a race against time, until we run out of money.	Jack Nicholson	money
I don't know what to do with it. I'm very fortunate to have it, and it gives you room to maneuver. But the main thing about having money is it means you don't have to worry about it. And that for me is a lovely thing. It's not for fast cars and hookers.	Daniel Radcliffe	money
Only the elites despise earning money.	Newt Gingrich	money
I've got my eye on a few things to spend my money on. I've got my own bank card but I am really good with money. I don't spend too much at all.	Justin Bieber	money
You have to spend a lot to make a lot. It's not like I'm sitting on top of a pile of money.	Katy Perry	money
As kids we didn't complain about being poor we talked about how rich we were going to be and made moves to get the lifestyle we aspired to by any means we could. And as soon as we had a little money, we were eager to show it.	Jay-Z	money
My body can't put anyone in jeopardy of not making money anymore - my body is just not on the table that way anymore.	Christina Aguilera	money
I have no idea how much money I've got.	Daniel Radcliffe	money

I like my money right where I can see it... hanging in my closet.	Sarah Jessica Parker	money
Hollywood is so fake and people need to realize that people are just people, and you, too, don't need to be born into something or have money or have whatever product someone is hawking on you.	Katy Perry	money
I think that lawyers are terrible at admitting that they're wrong. And not just admitting it also realizing it. Most lawyers are very successful, and they think that because they're making money and people think well of them, they must be doing everything right.	Alan Dershowitz	money
I think that money spoils most things, once it becomes the primary motivating force.	John Cleese	money

Hussein has chosen to spend his money on building weapons of mass destruction and palaces for his cronies.	Madeleine Albright	money
Ridiculous yachts and private planes and big limousines won't make people enjoy life more, and it sends out terrible messages to the people who work for them. It would be so much better if that money was spent in Africa - and it's about getting a balance.	Richard Branson	money
I grew up in a really small town with not a lot of money, and I liked singing, but it was just something that was a hobby.	Justin Bieber	money

I have a lot of money stashed away, but I do live my life from day to day.	Elton John	money
First and foremost I am a drummer. After that, I'm other things... But I didn't play drums to make money.	Ringo Starr	money
Financially, I've lost money and made money, but I know my way around financially.	Jack Nicholson	money
Selling out is doing something you don't really want to do for money. That's what selling out is.	Bono	money
I actually think that the economy has got some positives. It's got the market. It's got consumer confidence and it's got banks throwing - I mean central bankers throwing money at it around the world.	Jack Welch	money
Let's be honest, I have enough money to never have to work again.	Emma Watson	money
If anyone tells you it's impossible to be fabulous and smart and make a ton of money using math, well, they can just get in line behind you - and kiss your math.	Danica McKellar	money

I may be drunk, Miss, but in the morning I will be sober and you will still be ugly.	Winston Churchill	morning
And this President wakes up every morning, looks out across America and is proud to announce, 'It could be worse.' It could be worse? Is that what it means to be an American? It could be worse? Of course not. What defines us as Americans is our unwavering conviction that we know it must be better.	Mitt Romney	morning
Just in terms of allocation of time resources, religion is not very efficient. There's a lot more I could be doing on a Sunday morning.	Bill Gates	morning
A leaf fluttered in through the window this morning, as if supported by the rays of the sun, a bird settled on the fire escape, joy in the task of coffee, joy accompanied me as I walked.	Anais Nin	morning
The person who doesn't scatter the morning dew will not comb gray hairs.	Hunter S. Thompson	morning
To be intimate with a married man, when my own father cheated on my mother, is not something I could forgive. I could not look at myself in the morning if I did that. I wouldn't be attracted to a man who would cheat on his wife.	Angelina Jolie	morning
I have retired, but if there's anything that would kill me it is to wake up in the morning not knowing what to do.	Nelson Mandela	morning
I always do an all-night horror marathon on Saturdays where we start at seven and go until five in the morning.	Quentin Tarantino	morning

What inspires you, what excites you when you wake up in the morning?	Jennifer Aniston	morning
When I wake up in the morning, I feel just like any other insecure 24-year-old girl.	Lady Gaga	morning
I still, at hotel rooms, I do this one sort of not-so-cool thing: continually shoving my room service tray in front of someone else's door. Because I don't want the remnants. I don't want to be caught, like, being like the pig that I was at two in the morning.	Drew Barrymore	morning
I've just finished my 20th book this past year and I'm working on my 21st book about the Middle East right now that I'll finish this year. And I get up early in the morning and when I get tired of the computer and tired of doing research, I walk 20 steps out to my woodshop and I either build furniture or paint paintings. I'm an artist too.	Jimmy Carter	morning
I'm very happy with the way I look. I wake up some morning, catch myself in the bathroom mirror, and go, 'hey girl, you're alright'. But on the other hand, I find the website stuff, and the polls, something completely removed from my own personal life. You can't take anything like that too seriously, otherwise you'd end up in the loony bin.	Cameron Diaz	morning
One morning, just like 9/11, there's going to be a disaster. I have yet to see the United Nations do anything effective with either Iran or North Korea.	Newt Gingrich	morning
Most of the time I spend when I get up in the morning is trying to figure out what is going to happen.	Madeleine Albright	morning
Making love in the morning got me through morning sickness. I found I could be happy and throw up at the same time.	Pamela Anderson	morning
I'm not an employee who goes to the office every morning at the same time. Then, vacations are needed.	Karl Lagerfeld	morning
It didn't matter what you look like. You don't have to get up at 5:30 in the morning and there's a lot to be said for that. Corpse Bride can just play all my parts from now on and I'll just do the voice.	Helena Bonham Carter	morning
It's a privilege to serve the poor, to be servants of noble Africans, but I better belong in the rehearsal room or in the studio with my band. That's where I want to be and I still wake up in the morning with melodies in my head.	Bono	morning
Let me tell you, it is still morning in America. It just happens to be kind of a head pounding, hung over for four hours in America - and it's shaping up to be a nasty day, but its still morning in America.	Glenn Beck	morning
I was in Washington, D.C., on the morning show, by the time I was 18, programming a station by 19, No. 1 in the mornings. I think I was making, I don't know, a quarter of a million dollars by the time I was 25.	Glenn Beck	morning
I hear that 5 o'clock whistle in my mind like Fred Flintstone and I have to stop. I'm also not much of a morning writer. I have a sweet spot from about 11am to 4pm. But I really work during that time.	Diablo Cody	morning
I like being in movies that have a great story. I'm not so interested in being a Hollywood star. It's a job, you know. When you wake up at six in the morning every day for a week, it feels like hard work.	Kristen Stewart	morning
When I travel, I like to take advantage of room service. I'm really into eggs Benedict in the morning.	Jenny McCarthy	morning
But when I felt like I had something to prove? Then I got up early every morning and worked all day long. I didn't know if I had any more talent than anyone else directing, but I knew I could work hard at it, and so I did.	Ben Affleck	morning
Nowadays, everybody assumes, when they wake up in the morning, if they have a question, it will get answered. Because they have the internet. No matter what the question is, someone will answer their question.	Jack White	morning
It's never really that much fun for me to do movies anyway, because you - you know, you have to get up very early in the morning and you have to go in and you spend a lot of time waiting around.	Al Pacino	morning
I mean, if you have to wake up in the morning to be validated by the editorial page of the New York Times, you got a pretty sorry existence.	Karl Rove	morning
What is news? It's hard to quantify. Certainly news has changed completely, and the morning shows are not really designed to bring you the news, except to tell you what happened overnight, and the rest of it is a kind of magazine mentality - a little bit of this, a little bit of that. It's harder to be an educated and informed citizen.	Harrison Ford	morning
My days, if they start in the morning with a cuddle from my son, are just so much more glorious than they were prior to that.	Russell Crowe	morning
Sometimes I wake up in the morning and I am like, 'This is a high-top day' or 'This is a bob day,' but when I get my clothes on that's when I see.	Nicki Minaj	morning
When I get up in the morning and put on a pink or a green wig, I see myself as a piece of animation. It lets me be the person I want to be, a person who's not embarrassed to have fun.	Nicki Minaj	morning
I wake up laughing. Yes, I wake up in the morning and there I am just laughing my head off.	Bruce Willis	morning
London is completely unpredictable when it comes to weather. You'll start a scene, and it's a beautiful morning. You get there at 6 in the morning, set up, you start the scene, start shooting. Three hours later, it is pitch black and rainy.	David Schwimmer	morning
I have to say that when you tour the world, obviously, the jetlags and different hours and ways of living and traveling, a lot of hours in the plane, and you wake up in the morning and you're not quite sure where you are, and it is very tiring.	Celine Dion	morning
If you're changing the world, you're working on important things. You're excited to get up in the morning.	Larry Page	morning
The episodes all blend together for me, so I don't remember. I can't even remember what I had for breakfast this morning. I always feel I must be such a disappointment to them.	Sarah Michelle Gellar	morning
Every time I get up in the morning, melodies occur to me and I start trying to shape lyrics to melodies.	Andrew Bird	morning
I could announce one morning that the world was going to blow up in three hours and people would be calling in about my hair!	Katie Couric	morning
But, you know, they don't enjoy the dinner hour together. It's just not as much of a ritual at night and it's interesting. I think the ritual is taking place perhaps more in the morning.	Katie Couric	morning
But of course when people watch morning television, Terry, it's a very different animal. You know, they're running around, they're getting their kids ready for school, they're probably doing eight million things, they're brushing their teeth.	Katie Couric	morning
All three networks have always had a morning show but now cable of course is taking some of that audience away and a variety of other things, probably the Internet as well.	Katie Couric	morning
I wake up every morning and I feel like I'm juggling glass balls. I live in Los Angeles, my business is run out of London, and most evenings I'm cuddled up in front of Skype, in my dressing gown, speaking with my studio in London. I travel a lot, my team travel a lot, but I wouldn't have it any other way.	Victoria Beckham	morning
I made it a morning show. We have the coffee cup, we have the morning papers. It's got that feel to it, that's what I wanted.	Regis Philbin	morning
I've done the best I can with the morning show. I made it a morning show. We have the coffee cup, you have the morning papers, you know, it's got that feel to it, that's what I wanted.	Regis Philbin	morning
It means a lot in my business and its a wonderful feeling to be recognized for what you have done over a lifetime, but I didn't go crazy. I still eat my cereal in the morning, have a sandwich in the afternoon, go to bed at night. You know, nothing really different.	Regis Philbin	morning
I was up watching Meet Joe Black at four AM. I was hoping Brad Pitt would die, and he was still alive at seven forty in the morning! I actually felt sorry for once, for critics.	Rose McGowan	morning
Sometimes it's so weird just to do an interview. This morning I was back in my parents' house, with my brother, and we went for a jog together, then had breakfast as a family. And a couple of hours later I'm wearing high heels and a dress and makeup, and talking about my job.	Carey Mulligan	morning
I like everything perfect. Everything has to be neat. My sister is 5, and she's more messy than I am. I make my bed every morning, everything's perfect. My shoes are all arranged. It's sad. I'm a little like Ray, a little bit.	Dakota Fanning	morning
A creative man is motivated by the desire to achieve, not by the desire to beat others.	Ayn Rand	motivational
If you're going through hell, keep going.	Winston Churchill	motivational
Be miserable. Or motivate yourself. Whatever has to be done, it's always your choice.	Wayne Dyer	motivational
If you can dream it, you can do it.	Walt Disney	motivational

By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.	Benjamin Franklin	motivational
You have to learn the rules of the game. And then you have to play better than anyone else.	Albert Einstein	motivational
Determine never to be idle. No person will have occasion to complain of the want of time who never loses any. It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing.	Thomas Jefferson	motivational
Things do not happen. Things are made to happen.	John F. Kennedy	motivational
The secret of getting ahead is getting started.	Mark Twain	motivational
Well done is better than well said.	Benjamin Franklin	motivational
Quality is not an act, it is a habit.	Aristotle	motivational
Setting goals is the first step in turning the invisible into the visible.	Tony Robbins	motivational
You can't build a reputation on what you are going to do.	Henry Ford	motivational
To know oneself, one should assert oneself.	Albert Camus	motivational
You need to overcome the tug of people against you as you reach for high goals.	George S. Patton	motivational
Do not weep do not wax indignant. Understand.	Baruch Spinoza	motivational
Film spectators are quiet vampires.	Jim Morrison	movies
Am I a romantic? I've seen 'Wuthering Heights' ten times. I'm a romantic.	Johnny Depp	movies
Movies can and do have tremendous influence in shaping young lives in the realm of entertainment towards the ideals and objectives of normal adulthood.	Walt Disney	movies
The length of a film should be directly related to the endurance of the human bladder.	Alfred Hitchcock	movies
A film is - or should be - more like music than like fiction. It should be a progression of moods and feelings. The theme, what's behind the emotion, the meaning, all that comes later.	Stanley Kubrick	movies
If my films don't show a profit, I know I'm doing something right.	Woody Allen	movies
Everything makes me nervous - except making films.	Elizabeth Taylor	movies
It's the movies that have really been running things in America ever since they were invented. They show you what to do, how to do it, when to do it, how to feel about it, and how to look how you feel about it.	Andy Warhol	movies
A good film is when the price of the dinner, the theatre admission and the babysitter were worth it.	Alfred Hitchcock	movies
So, where's the Cannes Film Festival being held this year?	Christina Aguilera	movies
A lot of movies are about life, mine are like a slice of cake.	Alfred Hitchcock	movies
Movies are like an expensive form of therapy for me.	Tim Burton	movies
Every great film should seem new every time you see it.	Roger Ebert	movies
Even if I set out to make a film about a fillet of sole, it would be about me.	Federico Fellini	movies
Everyone told me to pass on Speed because it was a 'bus movie.'	Sandra Bullock	movies
Most of us do not consciously look at movies.	Roger Ebert	movies
There's an electrical thing about movies.	Oliver Stone	movies
My skin is hard when it comes to my music. But with my movies, I'm still a virgin in a lot of ways. I'm not used to being shot down for no reason.	Will Smith	movies
I think with movies I am really connecting to the Joseph Campbell idea of the collective unconscious.	Will Smith	movies
Over the years all these vampire movies have come out and nobody looks like a vampire anymore.	Johnny Depp	movies
One of my movies was called 'True Lies.' It's what the Democrats should have called their convention.	Arnold Schwarzenegger	movies
I was striving to be the most muscular man, and it got me into the movies. It got me everything that I have.	Arnold Schwarzenegger	movies
To me, movies and music go hand in hand. When I'm writing a script, one of the first things I do is find the music I'm going to play for the opening sequence.	Quentin Tarantino	movies
By going to the movies, and because of other things, too, going to college, making a wide variety of friends, moving around traveling, I became a lot more open-minded than the heritage I was born into might have suggested.	Roger Ebert	movies
I wanted to do another movie that could make us laugh and cry and feel good about the world. I wanted to do something else that could make us smile. This is a time when we need to smile more and Hollywood movies are supposed to do that for people in difficult times.	Steven Spielberg	movies
Movies are not about the weekend that they're released, and in the grand scheme of things, that's probably the most unimportant time of a film's life.	Quentin Tarantino	movies
I'm not a Hollywood basher because enough good movies come out of the Hollywood system every year to justify its existence, without any apologies.	Quentin Tarantino	movies
Movies are my religion and God is my patron. I'm lucky enough to be in the position where I don't make movies to pay for my pool. When I make a movie, I want it to be everything to me like I would die for it.	Quentin Tarantino	movies
If you just love movies enough, you can make a good one.	Quentin Tarantino	movies
All my movies are achingly personal.	Quentin Tarantino	movies
I have loved movies as the number one thing in my life so long that I can't ever remember a time when I didn't.	Quentin Tarantino	movies
I just grew up watching a lot of movies. I'm attracted to this genre and that genre, this type of story, and that type of story. As I watch movies I make some version of it in my head that isn't quite what I'm seeing - taking the things I like and mixing them with stuff I've never seen before.	Quentin Tarantino	movies
I don't really have a schedule of when I want to show my children my movies.	Steven Spielberg	movies
Sexiness, particularly in movies, is the chess game in the 'Thomas Crown Affair'. It's, it's, I don't know, but Faye Dunaway comes up a lot in that thinking. It's the subtlety of sexiness. The moment you try to be sexy, then it's not.	Daniel Craig	movies
I have been pregnant in so many movies it's ridiculous.	Jennifer Aniston	movies
There are a lot of movies that are unbelievable successes that I would be mortified to be a part of.	Jennifer Aniston	movies
I can be in 20 movies. But I'll never be an actor.	Jon Stewart	movies
Sex is a doorway to something so powerful and mystical, but movies usually depict it in a completely flat way.	David Lynch	movies
Not only do I have to live, right, I have to get some cash for my troubles - it's a scary thing, and people need to start to think about the messages that they send in the movies.	Morgan Freeman	movies
Everyone related to me in my circle was from church: church friends, church school, church activities. All my friends weren't allowed to watch MTV or go to PG-13 movies or listen to the radio, so I didn't really know anything different. That's how I was raised.	Katy Perry	movies
I'm doing 'Les Miserables,' the movie. I've done a lot of musicals and a lot of movies, and I know there are not a lot of people in Hollywood who have been down those two paths so I've been like, 'Come on, let's do a movie/musical.'	Hugh Jackman	movies
I have done many movies that people hadn't seen. 'The Fountain,' I spent a year on that. 'The Prestige' with Chris Nolan, and 'Australia.' From my perspective it's very satisfying. Some movies people see and other movies they don't. 'Wolverine,' 'X Men,' I know that in some level people know me just for that and it's fine for me.	Hugh Jackman	movies
I don't know what it was, maybe the movie theaters in my immediate surrounding neighbourhood in Burbank, but I never saw what would be considered A movies.	Tim Burton	movies
I never really got nightmares from movies. In fact, I recall my father saying when I was three years old that I would be scared, but I never was.	Tim Burton	movies
Even the worst Bond movies, there's something to love about them.	Daniel Craig	movies
I see a lot of movies. I love films as a spectator, and that's never obscured by the part of me that does the work myself. I just love going to the movies.	Daniel Day-Lewis	movies
My children have never watched any of my films. Charlie knows that daddy makes movies, but he says they are not good enough for him to watch.	Russell Crowe	movies
I still like the run and gun action movies and how truly dangerous it can be to make these films.	Megan Fox	movies
Frankly, I got into the movies because I like the movies a lot.	Jack Nicholson	movies
Sure, 'Twilight' is really huge right now and everybody's freaking out over it, but it will go away soon and I will be back to doing what I'm used to doing: weird little movies that nobody sees.	Kristen Stewart	movies
I have a very busy life, and not many people who have a career and four kids go out a lot to the movies.	Meryl Streep	movies
I think that's what distinguishes Schmidt, really. In the movies now, so much of what is appealing to an audience is the dramatic or has to do with science fiction, and Schmidt is simply human. There's no melodrama there's no device, It's just about a human being.	Jack Nicholson	movies
And what I like about it is it makes me happy and I think it makes a lot of people happy to go to the movies and to not think about the problems of the day or the problems of tomorrow or the yesterday and just go on for the ride and have the fun of losing oneself in a fantasy.	Nicolas Cage	movies
I wasn't allowed to go to movies when I was kid my father was a minister. 101 Dalmatians and King of Kings, that was the extent of it.	Denzel Washington	movies
I don't want to make movies for kids, and I don't want to make movies for adults either.	Kristen Stewart	movies
Well, everyone likes movies when they're a little kid.	Anthony Hopkins	movies
I played Winnie Cooper on 'The Wonder Years' from ages 12-18, and did a few other movies during some of the summers.	Danica McKellar	movies
I used to love to go to the movies - I'd see two in a row. A few times I even snuck into the second movie after it started... now that I think about it, that's kind of like shoplifting! Needless to say, I still love going to the movies, but I don't sneak in anymore.	Danica McKellar	movies
Most of the time it's the role. Sometimes it's the story and sometimes it just the paycheck. It's the little movies that come out as stories or the fact that I have work to go out, you know what I'm saying, you can only be out so long without work, you start getting antsy.	Morgan Freeman	movies
It can have an enormous effect because big budget movies can have big budget perks, and small budget movies have no perks, but what is the driving force, of course, is the script, and your part in it.	Morgan Freeman	movies
People need to start to think about the messages that they send in the movies.	Morgan Freeman	movies
I do not quote my own movies. I think I would be pretty insufferable if I did.	Diablo Cody	movies
People don't have these tidy little redemption arcs in reality the way they do in movies.	Diablo Cody	movies
I'm not an especially highbrow person, but I have always loved small, quirky, edgy movies.	Diablo Cody	movies
I don't know why, but I've always been a sucker for roller coasters in movies.	Diablo Cody	movies
It's not like I sit around watching my movies again and again, but I've never quite believed actors when they say they don't watch themselves.	Kristen Stewart	movies
The reason I chose the movies that I did was based on where they were being filmed.	Meryl Streep	movies
I wanted to be in Jim Carrey comedy movies before I met him. I wanted to be a comedian on Stage 19, yukking it up.	Jenny McCarthy	movies
You're creating new things in movies and people are going to steal them.	Daniel Craig	movies
When you're making movies you've got to get obsessive.	Daniel Craig	movies
I guess you could say I've been in my share of violent movies.	Daniel Craig	movies
I was sick and tired of being an English actor who did a lot of American movies because I was cheap and good.	Daniel Craig	movies
I always wanted to make movies.	Daniel Craig	movies
If I wanted to make spy movies for the rest of my life, that would be one thing, but I don't want to just make spy movies.	Daniel Craig	movies
I'm not a film buff. I don't watch a lot of movies.	Denzel Washington	movies
Growing up I didn't watch movies.	Denzel Washington	movies
I think we're very complicated and we're capable of all kinds of things, and movies don't reflect that.	Ryan Gosling	movies
I think it's more interesting to see people who don't feel appropriately. I relate to that, because sometimes I don't feel anything at all for things I'm supposed to, and other times I feel too much. It's not always like it is in the movies.	Ryan Gosling	movies
We can now have action movies with two stars where one might be African American and one might be Asian American. One of them doesn't have to be white, and the other one doesn't have to be the ethnic sidekick. We're way over that. And I think it's happening in society, too.	Roger Ebert	movies
I've made movies that we're very successful that we're a complete surprise, and I've made movies that I thought we're going to be very successful that, you know.	Christopher Walken	movies
My favorite characters are the ones that are the most successful movies.	Christopher Walken	movies
I've made three musical movies which is pretty good considering that not many are made but I was lucky in other ways. I came along when independent movies were starting to boom.	Christopher Walken	movies
When videotape came so a lot of movies that I do have a kind of afterlife in video. Things where movies that I do would come and go they still come and go but you can go rent them and see them on TV.	Christopher Walken	movies
I think if you do something effectively whether you're the lover or the comic or the action guy or the villain like I play movies are very expensive to make. Chances are you'll get asked to play that part again.	Christopher Walken	movies
I have been in movies that I thought I wasn't very good in.	Christopher Walken	movies
I make movies that nobody will see. I've made movies that even I have never seen.	Christopher Walken	movies
I used to be prettier than I am, but I think I look better now. I was a pretty boy. Particularly in my early movies. I don't like looking at them so much. There's a sort of pretty thing about me.	Christopher Walken	movies
I aim for a lifetime full of movies.	Salma Hayek	movies
I don't know why I don't watch a lot of movies I can barely keep up with the things my friends are in. There isn't enough time in life.	Meryl Streep	movies
And being as I'm somebody who loves movies like The Machinist, I also love going along to big mass entertainment movies. I get in the mood for all kinds of movies, and so I like to try each of them.	Christian Bale	movies
In terms of the romantic kind of lead, I just never enjoy those movies very much. Maybe they'll come to interest me more as I get older. I doubt it, but maybe. Romantic comedies tend to be, for me, an oxymoron.	Christian Bale	movies
There are movies that require fantasy and slightly more fantastical acting. Lines that are good for certain movies, in real life circumstances, would be absolutely unbelievable things to really say, and you would look at these people like they're freaks for conversing that way. But somehow for certain styles of movies, it works, and it seems fine.	Christian Bale	movies
I like the idea of movies having a magic element. How many times have you seen an actor in a movie who you know only as the character? It's wonderful, isn't it?	Christian Bale	movies
I don't get it when you get so much openness about the way movies are made, and the special effects and the behind-the-scenes stuff and all of that. I can't help but feel like this reduces it a little bit.	Christian Bale	movies
I always leave that for other people to decide, because some of the things I consider to be disasters are some people's favorite movies. And that's what I like so much, is that you never know. Something intrigues somebody and means nothing to somebody else.	Christian Bale	movies
Where I live, nobody who's fourteen is having sex and doing major drugs. And I think if you see it in the movies, you may be influenced by it. I think it's so important to preserve your innocence.	Natalie Portman	movies
There are movies where we are interested in seeing people's lives without agreeing with what they're doing.	Natalie Portman	movies
I've turned down twentysomething million dollars for movies.	Vin Diesel	movies
When I started to watch some of the films I'd done, I realized I was doing movies that I might not actually want to see.	Heath Ledger	movies
I just think old old movies, they make you concentrate and pay attention so much more. They feel so warm. A lot of modern digital videotape, it's just too bright. Don't know why, it's not warm.	Jack White	movies
Sundance is weird. The movies are weird - you actually have to think about them when you watch them.	Britney Spears	movies
I want to make all kinds of movies. I do want to make big movies that are a lot of fun to go to, but I also want to make movies that are going to stimulate some thought and maybe raise some awareness.	Nicolas Cage	movies
I do like to move and get physical in my movies.	Nicolas Cage	movies
I'm an enormous admirer of Christopher Lee. He's somebody, along with Vincent Price, who I celebrate, and I wanted my movies to show that celebration and that honoring of these great film stars that were unafraid to go into horror and Grand Guignol and the macabre.	Nicolas Cage	movies
I have eclectic tastes in the movies I want to do.	Nicolas Cage	movies
I don't want to just do independent movies and I don't want to just do adventure films. I enjoy both, and I think both are cogent.	Nicolas Cage	movies
I'm the first to admit that I like going to, or my memories at least of going to Clint Eastwood movies or Charles Bronson or James Bond.	Nicolas Cage	movies
I like fantasy. I like horror, science fiction because I can get avant-garde with those performances in those movies.	Nicolas Cage	movies
I care about the connection with the audience. Film is such a powerful medium. Movies can change the way people think.	Nicolas Cage	movies
I do enjoy animated movies.	Nicolas Cage	movies
You don't want to be photographed? You don't want to be known? Then you don't need to be out there peddling movies.	Cameron Diaz	movies
I haven't deliberately set out to play the blonde bombshell in my movies. In fact, it's probably been quite the opposite. After the success of The Mask, I wasn't offered all that many blonde bombshell parts, to be honest. I think people believed from the beginning that I could actually walk and talk at the same time.	Cameron Diaz	movies
I want to make movies that pierce people's hearts and touch them in some way, even if it's just for the night while they're in the cinema in that moment, I want to bring actual tears to their eyes and goosebumps to their skin.	Russell Crowe	movies
People wrestle sometimes making movies, and I think that conflict is a very essential thing. I think a lot of very happy productions have produced a lot of very banal movies.	Edward Norton	movies
I like making movies for myself and my friends and people with my sensibility.	Edward Norton	movies
I just love movies.	Edward Norton	movies
There's this index that tallies up how much your movies have made, and if they haven't grossed a certain amount, then you're not bankable. I know I'm not Will Smith but, you know, my ranking's pretty low. The only studio picture I've done is 'Zodiac,' and that didn't perform that well.	Chloe Sevigny	movies
I couldn't survive just doing independent movies. And I'd rather do modelling than movies or TV I didn't like.	Chloe Sevigny	movies
I didn't know what types of movies I wanted to do. I want to do things that are different. I want to take my time with each role.	Leonardo DiCaprio	movies
I just want to keep doing what I'm doing and hopefully people will watch my movies.	Leonardo DiCaprio	movies
I grew up when I was 15 when I had my first opportunity in movies. I watched every great movie for a year and a half, and since then I've asked myself how I can emulate such artistry. That's really my motivation. I want to do something as good as my heroes have done.	Leonardo DiCaprio	movies
I loved old black and white movies, especially the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers musicals. I loved everything about them - the songs, the music, the romance and the spectacle. They were real class and I knew that I wanted to be in that world.	Sharon Stone	movies
A lot of people just go to movies that feed into their preexisting and not so noble needs and desires: They just go to action pictures, and things like that.	Roger Ebert	movies
Class is often invisible in America in the movies, and usually not the subject of the film.	Roger Ebert	movies
Movies absorb our attention more completely, I think.	Roger Ebert	movies
The movies that are made more thoughtfully or made or with more ambition often get just get drowned out by the noise.	Roger Ebert	movies
I was watching 'Up In The Air' and I thought, 'Jesus, who's the old gray-haired guy?' And it was me. I never wear makeup for movies and now it's starting to show.	George Clooney	movies
My passion is doing movies, and as long as I keep doing that, I'll be happy. I want to do movies, fun roles and dramatic ones. I love all of it.	Vanessa Hudgens	movies
My passion is doing movies, so as long as I keep doing that I will be happy.	Vanessa Hudgens	movies
I'm fed up with the idiots... the ever-widening gap between people who know how to make movies and the people who green-light the movies.	Sean Connery	movies
I grew up on Bette Davis movies, and Marlene Dietrich, Marilyn Monroe.	Charlize Theron	movies
You have to get the audience invested even if you're doing something that they think is dumb, it's kind of what these movies are all about.	Halle Berry	movies
If you really want to be competitive in today's market you have to be in movies that make money.	Halle Berry	movies
And you also have to do movies that are about commerce because that's what is required of the industry today.	Halle Berry	movies
Usually when you see females in movies, they feel like they have these metallic structures around them, they are caged in by male energy.	Bjork	movies
I think what a lot of action movies lose these days, especially the ones that deal with fantasy, is you stop caring at some point because you've lost human scale.	Harrison Ford	movies
With the CGI, suddenly there's a thousand enemies instead of six - the army goes off into the horizon. You don't need that. The audience loses its relationship with the threat on the screen. That's something that's consistently happening and it makes these movies like video games and that's a soulless enterprise. It's all kinetics without emotion.	Harrison Ford	movies
Yes, I'm going to be the President of the United States. You know why? You think you can get chicks by being in the movies? You can really get chicks by being the President.	Ben Affleck	movies
I kinda see my current position like this: Here's your five minutes in the toy store, so you gotta do all the good movies you can before 'Chuck Woolery' rings the bell.	Ben Affleck	movies
The one benefit of having done all kinds of movies as an actor is, you learn the pros and cons of being tempted to do a really big movie because it costs a lot of money.	Ben Affleck	movies
You're basically the sum of all the experiences you've ever had, and they're sort of shaken up in you and reproduced in the things you create, and that includes seeing movies.	Ben Affleck	movies
Not that it entirely matters: There is a perception that all actors make their movies. A lot of people assume you're responsible. George Clooney told me actors get all of the blame and all the credit.	Ben Affleck	movies
My movies are unadorned, they're not particularly fancy, I think they're kind of workmanlike in some ways, focusing on the writing and the acting.	Ben Affleck	movies
I knew I had to get out of Boston and stop making movies there, at least for one movie, otherwise no one would ever consider me for a movie that took place south of Providence.	Ben Affleck	movies
I've never held myself up particularly high when I had movies that worked, and I never held myself all that low when I had failures.	Ben Affleck	movies
I always, always meant to be on stage. I only ended up even auditioning for television and movies because I was understudying a Turgenev play on Broadway and was so broke that, when I got a mini-series, I had to take it and was so ashamed because I was such a snob.	Jennifer Garner	movies
I was influenced when I was younger by the cartoon movies that Disney put out, like Cinderella and what not. I watched those movies over and over when I was younger and the music is ingrained into my head. Nowadays, I'm still humming the tunes. It taught me the fundamentals.	Zac Efron	movies
I like simple things. I like to sneak in the theatre and watch movies. I'm a movie buff.	Justin Timberlake	movies
If I did any movies I'd have to take a break from singing, because I'd want it to be really good.	Justin Timberlake	movies
I couldn't be happier about being a part of 'Hunger Games' and to play Katniss. I have a huge responsibility to the fans of this incredible book and I don't take it lightly. I will give everything I have to these movies and to this role to make it worthy of Suzanne Collins' masterpiece.	Jennifer Lawrence	movies
I never think it's right to chew gum in front of other people, but a lot of times I'll come in for a meeting chewing gum and I'll forget I'm chewing it. Then you don't want to swallow it because it stays in your system for seven years or something, so I've asked to throw it away. I've started to wonder if that's why I didn't get certain movies.	Jennifer Lawrence	movies
I do believe that movies are subject to a million interpretations.	Oliver Stone	movies
I loved the movies and I wanted to be like Marilyn Monroe. I thought she was so glamorous and everyone seemed to love her. I wanted to be like that and I told everyone I would be the next Marilyn Monroe.	Sharon Stone	movies
I like movies that are about real people in real time with real problems.	Josh Radnor	movies
I learned a lesson which I didn't heed: Don't put yourself in your movies. It's too much.	Josh Radnor	movies
I went through this very serious Woody Allen phase in college and a little bit after college. I still see his movies.	Josh Radnor	movies
I actually have a thing about proper nouns. They clang on my ear in a weird way when I hear them dropped into movies.	Josh Radnor	movies
When I go to movies and I love the movie, it's because it feels like it articulated something about how we're living now, and also gives me some insight into my own life. I feel actually altered after having seen it.	Josh Radnor	movies
A lot of times, we're just sold these movies that are really cynically conceived and marketed, and they just want you there opening weekend, before everybody finds out it's not so good.	Josh Radnor	movies
I didn't have any ambition to produce big mainstream popcorn movies.	Jodie Foster	movies
All through my life what I've loved doing is watching movies. I love the escapism of film, I love stories. So it is incredible to be able to be in them as much as I am, to see them from the first stitch in a costume to the end product.	Keira Knightley	movies
I filmed seven movies in 2011 and I think that was a mistake. I pushed myself too hard and I want to be able to come to work each day and give 100 percent. I guess I found out what my boundaries are.	Anna Kendrick	movies
I'm into 'The Walking Dead,' 'Shaun of the Dead,' obviously, and I've seen all the Romero movies. I am a classic zombie queen. And I love the White Walkers on 'Game of Thrones.' Weirdly, it wasn't until pretty late in life that I found my entry point into horror films.	Anna Kendrick	movies
For a number of years, I'd been around the kind of people who financed movies and the kind of people who are there to make the deals for movies. But I'd always had this naive idea that everybody wants to make movies as good as they can be, which is stupid.	David Fincher	movies
I don't like to watch my own movies - I fall asleep in my own movies.	Robert De Niro	movies
Movies are hard work. The public doesn't see that. The critics don't see it. But they're a lot of work. A lot of work.	Robert De Niro	movies
I'll work with a director if I think I'm going to get into a comfortable situation, and if it's someone I respect and who respects me, even if they're not so well known. Movies are hard to make, and you have to work toward a common ethic and do your best.	Robert De Niro	movies
Coming Home had been made before and Apocalypse Now and Deer Hunter, different kinds of movies.	Oliver Stone	movies
I'm terrible at horror movies, by the way. I get scared so easily.	Oliver Stone	movies
One of the joys of going to the movies was that it was trashy, and we should never lose that.	Oliver Stone	movies
I don't know if I see myself as really an action hero, but I like doing physical movies and I like doing movies where the writing is very lean.	Jodie Foster	movies
I love European movies and I kind of grew up on European films.	Jodie Foster	movies
If I have to produce movies, direct movies, whatever to change the way Hollywood treats older women, I'll do it. If I have to bend the rules, I will. If I have to break them, I will.	Naomi Watts	movies
I've always had this idea that I wanted movies to make people better not worse.	Jodie Foster	movies
So, yes, there's nothing I love more than listening to directors talk about their movies.	Jodie Foster	movies
The movies I made when I was 14 or 15, I have a hard time looking at those. Those were the awkward years. I don't know if anybody can look at something they did when they were 14 and not wince.	Jodie Foster	movies
Well, the thing about great fictional characters from literature, and the reason that they're constantly turned into characters in movies, is that they completely speak to what makes people human.	Keira Knightley	movies
I didn't know this about myself, but when 'Pirates of the Caribbean' came out I realised that I didn't enjoy a huge amount of recognition. I didn't react to it well, but I think life is about finding out who you are and what you like. So I started doing independent movies and art-house films instead.	Keira Knightley	movies
Books and movies are different art forms with different rules. And because of that, they never translate exactly.	Tom Clancy	movies
I worked so hard for so long - I did a lot of movies. I also worked a lot when my kids were smaller, before they were in school.	Michelle Pfeiffer	movies
There's always an imbalance with actors and actresses in the industry. And I think because there are just fewer movies overall being made, it's that trickle down effect.	Michelle Pfeiffer	movies
When I finally got up to Industrial Light And Magic to work on the 'Star Wars' movies as a model-maker, it felt like dying and going to heaven.	Adam Savage	movies
But when you're writing a script - for me anyway - you have to sort of create an enforced innocence. You have to divest yourself of worrying about a lot of stuff like what movies are hot, what movies are not hot, what the budget of this movie might be.	David Cronenberg	movies
Of course for many years directors have had to go on the road with their movies and promote them and I've done that since the beginning. So that's not new but the forms of it are different such as with the internet.	David Cronenberg	movies
Whenever I think about movies, I always look at that art process as having the best of a lot of worlds. Because if you watch a great film, you have a musical element to it, not just on the scoring, but in the way that the shots are edited - that has music and rhythm and time.	Frank Ocean	movies
The more unique your film is and unusual it is and difficult it is, the harder it is to get it financed. That's why a lot of good filmmakers are doing television. They do HBO movies.	David Cronenberg	movies
My favorite movies are movies that I go in and I leave deeply affected. Whether I laugh really hard or whether I cry really hard, I just want to feel really affected in that moment.	Shailene Woodley	movies
I like to think of myself as a fairly educated human being, but I'm a very uneducated actor when it comes to movies, directors, producers, actors for that matter.	Shailene Woodley	movies
I never wanted to do the same kind of movies over and over anyway, so my theory on it all is I'm just gonna try and dodge the label and keep doing what I am doing.	Matt Damon	movies
Success is not something I've wrapped my brain around. If people go to those movies, then yes, that's true, big-time success. If not, it's much ado about nothing.	Matt Damon	movies
If your movies don't perform, they just stop calling you.	Matt Damon	movies
That's the way this business works: if your movies do well at the box office, you will be offered more movies. It doesn't matter if you're a nice guy or you're a prick. If your movies do well, there's a job waiting for you in Hollywood. It's not any more complicated than that.	Matt Damon	movies
When I'm shooting a movie, I'm always in an invisible theater seat. I respect the fact that people have worked hard all week and want to go to the movies on the weekend and be entertained.	Michael Moore	movies
It's hard to incorporate dance into movies I think.	Jamie Bell	movies
I love the old Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly movies they're so beautiful to look at. It's such a shame we don't make them anymore. Although, I don't know how you could make tap dancing current and topical.	Jamie Bell	movies
I usually do get the tomboy parts in the movies, which is kind of like me, but not totally. I like to shop as much as Ashley, but she is a little more of a girlie-girl than me.	Mary-Kate Olsen	movies
Blessed are the hearts that can bend they shall never be broken.	Albert Camus	movingon
Forget the past.	Nelson Mandela	movingon
I must be careful not to get trapped in the past. That's why I tend to forget my songs.	Mick Jagger	movingon
Music doesn't lie. If there is something to be changed in this world, then it can only happen through music.	Jimi Hendrix	music
After silence, that which comes nearest to expressing the inexpressible is music.	Aldous Huxley	music
Music is everybody's possession. It's only publishers who think that people own it.	John Lennon	music
Music is my religion.	Jimi Hendrix	music
In music the passions enjoy themselves.	Friedrich Nietzsche	music
I don't make music for eyes. I make music for ears.	Adele	music
Music, in performance, is a type of sculpture. The air in the performance is sculpted into something.	Frank Zappa	music
Music is the strongest form of magic.	Marilyn Manson	music
Where words fail, music speaks.	Hans Christian Andersen	music
The iPod completely changed the way people approach music.	Karl Lagerfeld	music
He who joyfully marches to music in rank and file has already earned my contempt. He has been given a large brain by mistake, since for him the spinal cord would suffice.	Albert Einstein	music
The sexual embrace can only be compared with music and with prayer.	Marcus Aurelius	music
The man that hath no music in himself, Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds, is fit for treasons, stratagems and spoils.	William Shakespeare	music
Music inflames temperament.	Jim Morrison	music
Sometimes I feel like rap music is almost the key to stopping racism.	Eminem	music
Music is a safe kind of high.	Jimi Hendrix	music
If people take anything from my music, it should be motivation to know that anything is possible as long as you keep working at it and don't back down.	Eminem	music
When I die, I want people to play my music, go wild and freak out and do anything they want to do.	Jimi Hendrix	music
This land is your land and this land is my land, sure, but the world is run by those that never listen to music anyway.	Bob Dylan	music
Music is so therapeutic for me that if I can't get it out, I start feeling bad about myself - a lot of self-loathing.	Eminem	music
I've accomplished enough with the music that I haven't had to go out there and do other things to over-saturate.	Eminem	music
Without music to decorate it, time is just a bunch of boring production deadlines or dates by which bills must be paid.	Frank Zappa	music
I try to use my music to move these people to act.	Jimi Hendrix	music
The reflection of the world is blues, that's where that part of the music is at. Then you got this other kind of music that's tryin' to come around.	Jimi Hendrix	music
It is piracy, not overt online music stores, which is our main competitor.	Steve Jobs	music
My heart, which is so full to overflowing, has often been solaced and refreshed by music when sick and weary.	Martin Luther	music
Music makes me high on stage, and that's the truth. It's like being almost addicted to music.	Jimi Hendrix	music
People today are still living off the table scraps of the sixties. They are still being passed around - the music and the ideas.	Bob Dylan	music
Here's the thing with me and the religious thing. This is the flat-out truth: I find the religiosity and philosophy in the music. I don't find it anywhere else.	Bob Dylan	music
I became interested in folk music because I had to make it somehow.	Bob Dylan	music
Folk music is a bunch of fat people.	Bob Dylan	music
You can't imagine parlor ballads drifting out of high-rise multi-towered buildings. That kind of music existed in a more timeless state of life.	Bob Dylan	music
Look, when I started out, mainstream culture was Sinatra, Perry Como, Andy Williams, Sound of Music. There was no fitting into it then and of course, there's no fitting into it now.	Bob Dylan	music
If you don't know the blues... there's no point in picking up the guitar and playing rock and roll or any other form of popular music.	Keith Richards	music
Most people wouldn't know music if it came up and bit them on the ass.	Frank Zappa	music
My mother knew how to read music and everything. But I just kinda learned off of records. And so, I was listening to records and I'd play 'em over and over.	Clint Eastwood	music
Music is the voice that tells us that the human race is greater than it knows.	Napoleon Bonaparte	music
I like having my hair and face done, but I'm not going to lose weight because someone tells me to. I make music to be a musician not to be on the cover of Playboy.	Adele	music
Music for me, it demands full concentration.	Paulo Coelho	music
Poetry fettered, fetters the human race. Nations are destroyed or flourish in proportion as their poetry, painting, and music are destroyed or flourish.	William Blake	music
Music is always a commentary on society.	Frank Zappa	music
I enjoy all forms of music - pop, classical and opera.	Stephen Hawking	music
I want my fans to love themselves. It's almost like I want to hypnotize them so when they hear my music they love themselves instantly.	Lady Gaga	music
Music has healing power. It has the ability to take people out of themselves for a few hours.	Elton John	music
Rock and Roll: Music for the neck downwards.	Keith Richards	music
On the other hand, what I like my music to do to me is awaken the ghosts inside of me. Not the demons, you understand, but the ghosts.	David Bowie	music
When I was a teenager, I began to settle into school because I'd discovered the extracurricular activities that interested me: music and theater.	Morgan Freeman	music
I came into music just because I wanted the bread. It's true. I looked around and this seemed like the only way I was going to get the kind of bread I wanted.	Mick Jagger	music
Nothing pleases me more than to go into a room and come out with a piece of music.	Paul McCartney	music
I get bored easily, so I need to do a lot. I've started a record label, so I get to nurture new talent and talk about music, which is a passion of mine. I've written another book. And I get to come to work and do the TV show, which is always really fun.	Ellen DeGeneres	music
I'm a big collector of vinyl - I have a record room in my house - and I've always had a huge soundtrack album collection. So what I do, as I'm writing a movie, is go through all those songs, trying to find good songs for fights, or good pieces of music to layer into the film.	Quentin Tarantino	music
I had to resign myself, many years ago, that I'm not too articulate when it comes to explaining how I feel about things. But my music does it for me, it really does.	David Bowie	music
I decided to make music again at a time when I couldn't have had more obstacles.	Marilyn Manson	music
What I know is my music gets blamed for school shootings.	Marilyn Manson	music
The only things Mick and I disagree about is the band, the music and what we do.	Keith Richards	music
I felt I really wanted to back off from music completely and just work within the visual arts in some way. I started painting quite passionately at that time.	David Bowie	music
I think what made it difficult for people to get, and still makes it difficult for people to get, is the theatrical nature of the work and the fact that, my music doesn't exist without the performance-art element.	Lady Gaga	music
People haven't always been there for me, but music always has.	Taylor Swift	music
I think older people can appreciate my music because I really show my heart when I sing, and it's not corny. I think I can grow as an artist, and my fans will grow with me.	Justin Bieber	music
It was Elvis who really got me hooked on beat music. When I heard 'Heartbreak Hotel' I thought, this is it.	Paul McCartney	music
Music itself is going to become like running water or electricity. So it's like, just take advantage of these last few years because none of this is ever going to happen again. You'd better be prepared for doing a lot of touring because that's really the only unique situation that's going to be left.	David Bowie	music
I think the most important thing about music is the sense of escape.	Thom Yorke	music
I dropped out of NYU, moved out of my parent's house, got my own place, and survived on my own. I made music and worked my way from the bottom up.	Lady Gaga	music
I wanted to prove the sustaining power of music.	David Bowie	music
I don't profess to have music as my big wheel and there are a number of other things as important to me apart from music. Theatre and mime, for instance.	David Bowie	music
The absolute transformation of everything that we ever thought about music will take place within 10 years, and nothing is going to be able to stop it. I see absolutely no point in pretending that it's not going to happen. I'm fully confident that copyright, for instance, will no longer exist in 10 years.	David Bowie	music
I would love to continue in music, with writing... but I am not the kind of person who will hang around if I start to become irrelevant. If that happens, I will bow down gracefully, raise my kids, and have a garden. And I am going to let my hair go gray when I am older. I don't need to be blonde when I'm 60!	Taylor Swift	music
I think I first realized I wanted to be in country music and be an artist when I was 10. And I started dragging my parents to festivals, and fairs, and karaoke contests, and I did that for about a year before I came to Nashville for the first time. I was 11 and I had this demo CD of me singing Dixie Chicks and Leanne Rimes songs.	Taylor Swift	music

The Nobel Peace Prize opened up a door in my heart.	Aung San Suu Kyi	peace
It has been, after all, 11 years, more than a decade now, of defiance of U.N. resolutions by Saddam Hussein. Every obligation that he signed onto after the Gulf War, so that he would not be a threat to peace and security, he has ignored and flaunted.	Condoleezza Rice	peace
Israel can't make peace without the clear support of the United States.	Alan Dershowitz	peace
I am deeply concerned that, without peace and a two-state solution, the Jewish and democratic nature of Israel is in danger. That's why I have opposed Israel's settlement policy since 1973, and that's why I have favored a two-state solution since 1967.	Alan Dershowitz	peace
I am a peace supporting Jew.	Alan Dershowitz	peace

I love romantic poetry.	Richard Dawkins	poetry
As an actor, there is room for a certain amount of creativity, but you're always ultimately going to be saying somebody else's words.

I never really liked poetry readings I liked to read poetry by myself, but I liked singing, chanting my lyrics to this jazz group.	Leonard Cohen	poetry
I always thought that poetry is the verdict that others give to a certain kind of writing. So to call yourself a poet is a kind of dangerous description. It's for others it's for others to use.	Leonard Cohen	poetry
I think the term poet is a very exalted term and should be applied to a man at the end of his work. When he looks back over the body of his work and he's written poetry then let the verdict be that he's a poet.	Leonard Cohen	poetry
I always wrote poetry and stuff like that, so putting songs together wasn't that spectacular.	Amy Winehouse	poetry

Relationships based on obligation lack dignity.	Wayne Dyer	relationship
When I got my first television set, I stopped caring so much about having close relationships.	Andy Warhol	relationship
A relationship isn't going to make me survive. It's the cherry on top.	Jennifer Aniston	relationship
Every relationship I've been in, I've overwhelmed the girl. They just can't handle all the love.	Justin Timberlake	relationship
I'm more of an adventurous type than a relationship type.	Bob Dylan	relationship
So then, the relationship of self to other is the complete realization that loving yourself is impossible without loving everything defined as other than yourself.	Alan Watts	relationship
I have to be in a relationship in order to be intimate. I'm not the one-night-stand kind of girl. Despite the rumors.	Kim Kardashian	relationship
I could see myself in a relationship with a girl Olivia Wilde is so sexy she makes me want to strangle a mountain ox with my bare hands. She's mesmerizing.	Megan Fox	relationship
If one could be friendly with women, what a pleasure - the relationship so secret and private compared with relations with men. Why not write about it truthfully?	Virginia Woolf	relationship
But with Christ, we have access in a one-to-one relationship, for, as in the Old Testament, it was more one of worship and awe, a vertical relationship. The New Testament, on the other hand, we look across at a Jesus who looks familiar, horizontal. The combination is what makes the Cross.	Bono	relationship
It's important to take time for your spouse and nurture the relationship.	Christina Aguilera	relationship
There is but one way for a president to deal with Congress, and that is continuously, incessantly, and without interruption. If it is really going to work, the relationship has got to be almost incestuous.	Lyndon B. Johnson	relationship
I definitely think anything I'd be in now is a permanent relationship.	Kim Kardashian	relationship
There was at time in my life where all I wanted was a relationship, and I thought that was the most important thing.	Kim Kardashian	relationship
Being grown up and in a serious relationship, I've learned so much. I'm happier than I've every been.	Paris Hilton	relationship
I think a good relationship is about collaboration.	Jennifer Aniston	relationship
And it was a very, very fruitful and great relationship between the Stones and The Beatles. It was very, very friendly.	Keith Richards	relationship
The relationship to one's fellow man is the relationship of prayer, the relationship to oneself is the relationship of striving it is from prayer that one draws the strength for one's striving.	Franz Kafka	relationship
In the grip of a neurological disorder, I am fast losing control of words even as my relationship with the world has been reduced to them.	Christopher Hitchens	relationship
I'm afraid the SS's relationship with the Catholic Church is something the Church still has to deal with and does not deny.	Christopher Hitchens	relationship
Until we have a better relationship between private performance and the public truth, as was demonstrated with Watergate, we as the public are absolutely right to remain suspicious, contemptuous even, of the secrecy and the misinformation which is the digest of our news.	John le Carre	relationship
The test of one's behavior pattern is their relationship to society, relationship to work and relationship to sex.	Alfred Adler	relationship
As you get older you have more respect and empathy for your parents. Now I have a great relationship with both of them.	Hugh Jackman	relationship
I have a strange relationship with time. I'm not aware of it passing.	Daniel Day-Lewis	relationship

I feel so lucky to have both a son and a daughter, because there's a different relationship with each of them.	Hugh Jackman	relationship
I have a great relationship with my mother-in-law. We're both Leos, we understand each other.	Tori Amos	relationship
When I play live, it's a conversation that we're all having with the song, and the audience... their response and relationship with the songs is as valid as my relationship with the songs.	Tori Amos	relationship
When you think about it, we actors are kind of prostitutes. We get paid to feign attraction and love. Other people are paying to watch us kissing someone, touching someone, doing things people in a normal monogamous relationship would never do with anyone who's not their partner. It's really kind of gross.	Megan Fox	relationship
I feel like the people from Iceland have a different relationship with their country than other places. Most Icelandic people are really proud to be from there, and we don't have embarrassments like World War II where we were cruel to other people.	Bjork	relationship
I think I have a strange relationship with time. I'm not really aware of that time passing. I don't feel that I'm wasteful with time. But I'm not aware of it passing.	Daniel Day-Lewis	relationship
I had a very, very difficult relationship with my mother, who was supremely self-centred. She was hilariously self-centred. She did not really take interest in anything that didn't immediately affect her.	John Cleese	relationship
I know children regress after vaccination because it happened to my own son. Why aren't there any tests out there on the safety of how vaccines are administered in the real world, six at a time? Why have only two of the 36 shots our kids receive been looked at for their relationship to autism?	Jenny McCarthy	relationship
I think the fact that I'm so well known to be gay makes it very difficult to have a convincing relationship with a woman on screen. It wouldn't be at all difficult for me to kiss a woman - I'll kiss a frog if you like.	Stephen Fry	relationship
I think the most important thing in life is self-love, because if you don't have self-love, and respect for everything about your own body, your own soul, your own capsule, then how can you have an authentic relationship with anyone else?	Shailene Woodley	relationship
I've always believed in people's capacity for goodness. I still believe that people are good. What I'm not so trusting about anymore is their relationship to their own goodness.	Anne Hathaway	relationship
It is better to have a relationship with someone who cheats on you than with someone who does not flush the toilet.	Uma Thurman	relationship
I think at some stage, I would love to have another child. I would love to settle into a relationship that was really important to me. I actually am not good at the balance at that.	Nicole Kidman	relationship
Even as a child I had a strong relationship with yearning and desire. And loss. Those things spoke to me.	Nicole Kidman	relationship
But you know, I have a pretty good relationship with the press and the paparazzi. It's just when they step over the line that, you know, enough's enough.	Elton John	relationship
What works in a relationship of very public people is not making the relationship public - keeping it as personal as it can be. It's the only way it is real.	Salma Hayek	relationship
Look, you've got a generation of people coming along who are going to form their own new relationship with the idea of supporting the causes that they care about or changing the world. And these people are not going to do it the way our parents do it.	Edward Norton	relationship
There's a lot about the character. It doesn't always happen, but there are some characters you really create a relationship with, almost as if they were your friend. And you never get into their heads again or think like them.	Salma Hayek	relationship
In a relationship, when does the art of compromise become compromising?	Sarah Jessica Parker	relationship
When they watch a movie and they know that you're in a relationship, you just kind of watch that constantly.	Charlize Theron	relationship
The thing that stood out above and beyond all the experiences was this relationship with the nine-month-old baby. On weekends, I'd be thinking about going back to set on Monday just to see the baby.	Vin Diesel	relationship
I think every relationship has a point where you stop and reevaluate. Are you happy? Have you grown together or apart? What do you share interests in? I think that's a normal thing to do, but it's so much harder when it's done publicly.	Courteney Cox	relationship
I have a much better relationship with the press than I did, I think because I stood my ground.	Elton John	relationship
But I think the real tension lies in the relationship between what you might call the pursuer and his quarry, whether it's the writer or the spy.	John le Carre	relationship
I'm always open to a relationship, but I'm not putting those feelers out there now.	Charlize Theron	relationship
I am a relationship girl. That's kind of just how I'm made... When you're in my life, it's actually very contained.	Charlize Theron	relationship
I grew up very religious, and I don't have a great relationship with religion.	Brad Pitt	relationship
There's such an extreme feeling to be in love, especially in quite an emotionally destructive relationship, where you're both kind of really bad for each other, but you love each other so much. Those extreme emotions, I think, can only be described with extreme imagery.	Florence Welch	relationship
It takes bravery to end a relationship.	Leona Lewis	relationship
Obviously, a long-distance relationship is hard. But, like anything worth having, you make it work.	Leona Lewis	relationship
You know when you get into that thing where people want to discuss the relationship? I'd rather discuss what was on telly, avoid the issue, discuss anything other than the relationship.	Jarvis Cocker	relationship
This thing with everyone knowing you, it's weird, because people have this one-sided relationship where they look at your picture and feel they know you more than someone they actually know. I don't really know myself that well.	Robert Pattinson	relationship
I'm not one of these guys who's constantly in a relationship, not at all.	Robert Pattinson	relationship
When a relationship doesn't work anymore, it's terrible to stay with someone that you don't love.	Monica Bellucci	relationship
I've stepped more into my womanhood, I'm a mother now, I'm having a beautiful relationship as a wife and as a friend.	Alicia Keys	relationship
I'd think,'In a relationship, we should never have his kind of fight.' Then, instead of figuring out how to make it work, I looked for a way to get out of it. The truth is, you shouldn't be married if your that kind of person.	George Clooney	relationship
I'm certainly not the first person to be in a relationship with a younger man, but somehow I was plucked out as a bit of a poster girl.	Demi Moore	relationship
I have had a love-hate relationship with my body.	Demi Moore	relationship
I think she definitely has. I think, um, her and Mulder's relationship has become more equal. And, I think she has become stronger and more independent over the seasons.	Gillian Anderson	relationship
It's impossible. You try to have any kind of relationship with your family, with a man, or with a friend, and you have to be on the phone and the Internet the entire time.	Keira Knightley	relationship
Over the years, I've been trying to build a relationship with an audience. I've tried to maintain as much of a low profile as I could so that those characters would emerge and their relationship with audiences would be protected.	Kevin Spacey	relationship
I also think the relationship I have with my audience is a lot more complex than what Hitchcock seemed to want his to be - although I think he had more going on under the surface as well.	David Cronenberg	relationship
Well I think if you really go out with someone for quite a long time you do get to know each other very, very well, you go through the good times, you go through the bad times. You know both personally, but also within a relationship as well.	Kate Middleton	relationship
I had never really dated. I've always been a relationship kind of person.	Bruce Willis	relationship
Certain people in the United States are driving nails into this structure of our relationship, then cutting off the heads. So the Soviets must use their teeth to pull them out.	Mikhail Gorbachev	relationship
Though I still have no semblance of a life outside of Nine Inch Nails at the moment, I realize my goals have gone from getting a record deal or selling another record to being a better person, more well-rounded, having friends, having a relationship with somebody.	Trent Reznor	relationship
Everyone has an opinion of who you are and what your relationship is about, things that you've done or didn't do in your relationship - and it's just all crap, really. Things that are written about it are all crap.	Jessica Alba	relationship
First of all, returning from motherhood, I was looking for something lighter, and I wasn't as much attracted to Kate as I was to the relationship between the two people.	Tea Leoni	relationship
But it's much more exciting to make Die Hard. One of the reasons that I think that movie is so successful is it deals with those very important blue-collar relationship themes. But it's more visually beautiful to show things blowing up. It just gives you more on the screen.	Penn Jillette	relationship
I don't remember any sibling rivalry growing up, because by the time I was really conscious, Tom was going away to college. My relationship with him, which is a very close one, really developed in more recent years.	David Hyde Pierce	relationship
I know the Russian political elite has got used to the Ukraine suffering from an inferiority complex, but I want this to disappear from our relationship.	Yulia Tymoshenko	relationship
I like your Christ, I do not like your Christians. Your Christians are so unlike your Christ.	Mahatma Gandhi	religion
Religion is what keeps the poor from murdering the rich.	Napoleon Bonaparte	religion
When the missionaries came to Africa they had the Bible and we had the land. They said 'Let us pray.' We closed our eyes. When we opened them we had the Bible and they had the land.	Desmond Tutu	religion
Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind.	Albert Einstein	religion
My religion consists of a humble admiration of the illimitable superior spirit who reveals himself in the slight details we are able to perceive with our frail and feeble mind.	Albert Einstein	religion
I am a deeply religious nonbeliever - this is a somewhat new kind of religion.	Albert Einstein	religion
True religion is real living living with all one's soul, with all one's goodness and righteousness.	Albert Einstein	religion
One strength of the communist system of the East is that it has some of the character of a religion and inspires the emotions of a religion.	Albert Einstein	religion
I care not much for a man's religion whose dog and cat are not the better for it.	Abraham Lincoln	religion
A religion that takes no account of practical affairs and does not help to solve them is no religion.	Mahatma Gandhi	religion
It is in our lives and not our words that our religion must be read.	Thomas Jefferson	religion
A tyrant must put on the appearance of uncommon devotion to religion. Subjects are less apprehensive of illegal treatment from a ruler whom they consider god-fearing and pious. On the other hand, they do less easily move against him, believing that he has the gods on his side.	Aristotle	religion
Difference of opinion is advantageous in religion. The several sects perform the office of a Censor - over each other.	Thomas Jefferson	religion
Every religion is true one way or another. It is true when understood metaphorically. But when it gets stuck in its own metaphors, interpreting them as facts, then you are in trouble.	Joseph Campbell	religion
Gentleness, self-sacrifice and generosity are the exclusive possession of no one race or religion.	Mahatma Gandhi	religion

All who think cannot but see there is a sanction like that of religion which binds us in partnership in the serious work of the world.	Benjamin Franklin	religion

Religion is the impotence of the human mind to deal with occurrences it cannot understand.	Karl Marx	religion
There is not enough religion in the world even to destroy religion.	Friedrich Nietzsche	religion
Religion is just mind control.	George Carlin	religion
It's not surprising, then, they get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren't like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations.	Barack Obama	religion
The more powerful and original a mind, the more it will incline towards the religion of solitude.	Aldous Huxley	religion
Religion is the opium of the masses.	Karl Marx	religion

Nothing can be more contrary to religion and the clergy than reason and common sense.	Voltaire	religion
It was not a religion that attacked us that September day. It was al-Qaeda. We will not sacrifice the liberties we cherish or hunker down behind walls of suspicion and mistrust.	Barack Obama	religion
Skeptical scrutiny is the means, in both science and religion, by which deep thoughts can be winnowed from deep nonsense.	Carl Sagan	religion
There is no surer sign of decay in a country than to see the rites of religion held in contempt.	Niccolo Machiavelli	religion
I say quite deliberately that the Christian religion, as organized in its Churches, has been and still is the principal enemy of moral progress in the world.	Bertrand Russell	religion
Whoever seeks to set one religion against another seeks to destroy all religion.	Franklin D. Roosevelt	religion

Religion is an illusion and it derives its strength from the fact that it falls in with our instinctual desires.	Sigmund Freud	religion
One of the things that is wrong with religion is that it teaches us to be satisfied with answers which are not really answers at all.	Richard Dawkins	religion
As with the Christian religion, the worst advertisement for Socialism is its adherents.	George Orwell	religion
Religion is excellent stuff for keeping common people quiet.	Napoleon Bonaparte	religion
In nearly every religion I am aware of, there is a variation of the golden rule. And even for the non-religious, it is a tenet of people who believe in humanistic principles.	Hillary Clinton	religion
Many of us saw religion as harmless nonsense. Beliefs might lack all supporting evidence but, we thought, if people needed a crutch for consolation, where's the harm? September 11th changed all that.	Richard Dawkins	religion
We are a nation that is unenlightened because of religion. I do believe that. I think religion stops people from thinking. I think it justified crazies.	Bill Maher	religion
The day is not far off when the economic problem will take the back seat where it belongs, and the arena of the heart and the head will be occupied or reoccupied, by our real problems - the problems of life and of human relations, of creation and behavior and religion.	John Maynard Keynes	religion
Nothing is so fatal to religion as indifference.	Edmund Burke	religion
Superstition is the religion of feeble minds.	Edmund Burke	religion

I think flying planes into a building was a faith-based initiative. I think religion is a neurological disorder.	Bill Maher	religion
It would be intolerant if I advocated the banning of religion, but of course I never have.	Richard Dawkins	religion
The humanists' replacement for religion: work really hard and somehow you'll either save yourself or you'll be immortal. Of course, that's a total joke, and our progress is nothing. There may be progress in technology but there's no ethical progress whatsoever.	David Bowie	religion
Religion is not a department of life it is something that enters into the whole of it.	Alan Watts	religion
The Christian religion not only was at first attended with miracles, but even at this day cannot be believed by any reasonable person without one.	David Hume	religion
My first memories of religion were being taken to Episcopal church. My father was Catholic, but my mother, I believe, was Episcopal. So I sort of veered off into the watered-down version of Catholicism.	Marilyn Manson	religion
Religion is the recognition of all our duties as divine commands.	Immanuel Kant	religion
There is no higher religion than human service. To work for the common good is the greatest creed.	Woodrow Wilson	religion
Generally speaking, the errors in religion are dangerous those in philosophy only ridiculous.	David Hume	religion
You know, religion itself, Eastern and Western, is divisive and quarrelsome anyway.	Deepak Chopra	religion

If I don't talk about my religion, if I say I'm not discussing it or different humanitarian things I'm working on, they're like, 'He's avoiding it.' If I do talk about it, it becomes, 'Oh, he's proselytizing.'	Tom Cruise	religion
God's love is too great to be confined to any one side of a conflict or to any one religion.	Desmond Tutu	religion
It's one thing to be religious, but it's another thing to make religion your policy.	Madeleine Albright	religion
Religion is compulsory in English schools, you know.	Christopher Hitchens	religion
Religion is not going to come up with any new arguments.	Christopher Hitchens	religion
I don't think Romney is wacky at all, but religion makes intelligent people say and do wacky things, believe and affirm crazy things. Left on his own, Romney would never have said something like the Garden Of Eden was in Missouri, and will be again.	Christopher Hitchens	religion
The fact that religion plays such a part in how people vote troubles me, troubles me as a minister's daughter. Because I always felt that the separation of church and state was what our forefathers and foremothers really fought for.	Tori Amos	religion
There's a gullible side to the American people. They can be easily misled. Religion is the best device used to mislead them.	Michael Moore	religion
I'm very interested in religion as something to study, but I'm not a religious person in the slightest.	Daniel Radcliffe	religion
Religion leaves no room for human complexity.	Daniel Radcliffe	religion
I'm not defined by where I came from. I never took part in the rules and hatred that sometimes go along with religion. But if my parents are happy with what they believe, then I'm happy to stay out of their way. We agree to disagree.	Katy Perry	religion
I love the idea of the teachings of Jesus Christ and the beautiful stories about it, which I loved in Sunday school and I collected all the little stickers and put them in my book. But the reality is that organised religion doesn't seem to work. It turns people into hateful lemmings and it's not really compassionate.	Elton John	religion
Religion can be the enemy of God. It's often what happens when God, like Elvis, has left the building.	Bono	religion
The major civilizing force in the world is not religion, it is sex.	Hugh Hefner	religion
I do not know how to teach philosophy without becoming a disturber of established religion.	Baruch Spinoza	religion
I love religion.	Jessica Simpson	religion
9/11 was a deliberate, carefully planned evil act of the long-waged war on the West by Koran-inspired soldiers of Allah around the world. They hated us before George W. Bush was in office. They hated us before Israel existed. And the avengers of the religion of perpetual outrage will keep hating us.	Michelle Malkin	religion
If I were asked for a one-sentence sound bite on religion, I would say I was against it.	Salman Rushdie	religion
I was 21 in 1968, so I'm as much a child of the '60s as is possible to be. In those years the subject of religion had really almost disappeared the idea that religion was going to be a major force in the life of our societies, in the West anyway, would have seemed absurd in 1968.	Salman Rushdie	religion
Well, right now, I'm very fascinated with 1920s Berlin. I mean, probably the more interesting thing would be to go to the beginning of civilization or precivilization - like polytheistic times. It would be interesting to see what came before modern religion and culture - what circumstances created the environment or the need for it.	Natalie Portman	religion
You know, I get much more Jewish in Israel because I like the way that religion is done there.	Natalie Portman	religion
Twenty five percent of Israeli citizens are not even Jewish. Anybody can become an Israeli citizen if you qualify. Religion is not a criterion for citizenship.	Alan Dershowitz	religion
I love it when the left and when the president say, 'Don't try to impose your values on us, you folks who hold your Bibles in your hand and cling to your guns.' They have values too. Our values are based on religion, based on life. Their values are based on a religion of self.	Rick Santorum	religion
When asked if I consider myself Buddhist, the answer is, Not really. But it's more my religion than any other because I was brought up with it in an intellectual and spiritual environment. I don't practice or preach it, however.	Uma Thurman	religion
First of all, the Jewish religion has a great deal in common with the Christian religion because, as Rabbi Gillman points out in the show, Christianity is based on Judaism. Christ was Jewish.	Barbara Walters	religion
It's fun being in Islamic countries, to know there's only one religion. There's order. You wear a burqa. There's no choice. People are happy with that.	Prince	religion
To play June, I had an immediate connect with her background and culture. We grew up with the same religion and shared a lot of the same values of family and spirituality. But I was really so inspired by what a modern woman she was.	Reese Witherspoon	religion
I found it interesting that as people become more technically oriented all over the world, at the same time people are becoming increasingly spiritual. The success of the Da Vinci code - even though it was a great yawn - also showed people's interest in religion.	Barbara Walters	religion
The only difference is that religion is much better organised and has been around much longer, but it's the same story with different characters and different costumes.	James Randi	religion
An individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for the law.	Martin Luther King, Jr.	respect
Everyone should be respected as an individual, but no one idolized.	Albert Einstein	respect
Let every man be respected as an individual and no man idolized.	Albert Einstein	respect

When people do not respect us we are sharply offended yet in his private heart no man much respects himself.	Mark Twain	respect
Go up close to your friend, but do not go over to him! We should also respect the enemy in our friend.	Friedrich Nietzsche	respect
I have no right, by anything I do or say, to demean a human being in his own eyes. What matters is not what I think of him it is what he thinks of himself. To undermine a man's self-respect is a sin.	Antoine de Saint-Exupery	respect
To the living we owe respect, but to the dead we owe only the truth.	Voltaire	respect
To be one, to be united is a great thing. But to respect the right to be different is maybe even greater.	Bono	respect
One who breaks an unjust law that conscience tells him is unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for law.	Martin Luther King, Jr.	respect
I submit that an individual who breaks the law that conscience tells him is unjust and willingly accepts the penalty by staying in jail to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the very highest respect for law.	Martin Luther King, Jr.	respect
The British nation is unique in this respect. They are the only people who like to be told how bad things are, who like to be told the worst.	Winston Churchill	respect
We do not covet anything from any nation except their respect.	Winston Churchill	respect
We are more thoroughly an enlightened people, with respect to our political interests, than perhaps any other under heaven. Every man among us reads, and is so easy in his circumstances as to have leisure for conversations of improvement and for acquiring information.	Benjamin Franklin	respect
One should respect public opinion insofar as is necessary to avoid starvation and keep out of prison, but anything that goes beyond this is voluntary submission to an unnecessary tyranny.	Bertrand Russell	respect
There may be fairies at the bottom of the garden. There is no evidence for it, but you can't prove that there aren't any, so shouldn't we be agnostic with respect to fairies?	Richard Dawkins	respect
We reserve our deepest respect and admiration for those who volunteer for service and give their lives to help keep our nation secure.	Mitt Romney	respect
We learned about gratitude and humility - that so many people had a hand in our success, from the teachers who inspired us to the janitors who kept our school clean... and we were taught to value everyone's contribution and treat everyone with respect.	Michelle Obama	respect
I hate victims who respect their executioners.	Jean-Paul Sartre	respect
There is no need to worry about mere size. We do not necessarily respect a fat man more than a thin man. Sir Isaac Newton was very much smaller than a hippopotamus, but we do not on that account value him less.	Bertrand Russell	respect
Respect the burden.	Napoleon Bonaparte	respect
Against my will, in the course of my travels, the belief that everything worth knowing was known at Cambridge gradually wore off. In this respect my travels were very useful to me.	Bertrand Russell	respect
Find your self-respect now. Don't dumb yourselves down. Think of yourself as capable and worthy of finding a guy who is going to respect you, too. It's so important, I mean, and the confidence you get from feeling smart and tackling something like mathematics, which is a challenge, right? Math is hard.	Danica McKellar	respect
I, for one, respect those who believe with all their hearts and conscience that there are no circumstances under which any abortion should ever be available.	Hillary Clinton	respect
I have more respect for a man who lets me know where he stands, even if he's wrong. Than the one who comes up like an angel and is nothing but a devil.	Malcolm X	respect
The Arab League tells us to go in and take out Qaddafi. We've spent billions of dollars already with respect to the Arab League. Billions of dollars, because they told us to do it. Why aren't they paying for it? They don't like Qaddafi, Qaddafi's been a terrible thorn in their side.	Donald Trump	respect
Respect for right conduct is felt by every body.	Jane Austen	respect
I love making new friends and I respect people for a lot of different reasons.	Taylor Swift	respect
I'm an atheist, but I'm very relaxed about it. I don't preach my atheism, but I have a huge amount of respect for people like Richard Dawkins who do.	Daniel Radcliffe	respect
I like to be bought flowers and taken out for dinner. I like a man to be a gentleman. I don't like to be treated as if I am brainless. I like to be respected and to give respect.	Sharon Stone	respect
I don't believe war is a way to solve problems. I think it's wrong. I don't have respect for the people that made the decisions to go on with war. I don't have that much respect for Bush. He's about war, I'm not about war - a lot of people aren't about war.	Avril Lavigne	respect
I think every religious person should have a deep sense of respect for other people's religious documents and religious symbols just as we were deeply opposed to the Taliban destroying the two historic buddhas which they blew up. So I think we ought to all oppose burning the Koran.	Newt Gingrich	respect
I don't envy or much respect people who are completely politicised.	Christopher Hitchens	respect
When I'm getting to know someone, I look for someone who has passions that I respect, like his career. Someone who loves what he does is really attractive.	Taylor Swift	respect
I will not speak with disrespect of the Republican Party. I always speak with respect of the past.	Woodrow Wilson	respect
To get down to the quick of it, respect motivates me - not success.	Hugh Jackman	respect
What I respect as far as in myself and in others is the spirit of just doing it. For better or worse, it may work and it may not, but I'm going to go for it. Ultimately I probably prefer to be respected for that than whether it works out or not, either winning or losing.	Hugh Jackman	respect
I'm a good girl because I really believe in love, integrity, and respect.	Katy Perry	respect
I really don't spend any time on the Internet, so I guess I live a little under a rock in that respect.	Christina Aguilera	respect

I will have to earn trust and respect from my kids.	Tiger Woods	respect

If I respect myself and believe in what I'm doing, no one can touch me.	Fiona Apple	respect

You totally value and respect your body as you get older.	Jenny McCarthy	respect
Hip-hop is more about attaining wealth. People respect success. They respect big. They don't even have to like your music. If you're big enough, people are drawn to you.	Jay-Z	respect
I remember I read this harsh review about my show, and one of my friends told me that this was the exact same stuff people said about Madonna. And it's like, she didn't care. Madonna just came out and was herself. I respect that a lot.	Britney Spears	respect
I have respect for beer.	Russell Crowe	respect
All due respect and trying to be as modest as I can be, I am a dancer. But I don't think I would be on 'Dancing with the Stars,' mainly because I would be too shy.	Al Pacino	respect
I know people that I respect and admire and look up to who have had extra-marital affairs.	Gwyneth Paltrow	respect
I think we need to significantly reduce the regulatory burden on the private sector. The Obama administration is doing the opposite. They're loading on more and more regulation on the private respect to how the economy functions.	Dick Cheney	respect
That's the most important thing to me - that if I'm gonna spend however long it takes to make a movie, give up 14 hours a day for however many weeks or months, then it's very important for me to know that I'm working with people who I respect and enjoy and that we're going for something together.	Brad Pitt	respect
I have respect for what other people believe. What I believe in my own life is that it's a search for how I can do things better, whether it's being a better man or a better father or finding ways for myself to improve.	Tom Cruise	respect
I always remember having a healthy respect for my grandmother.	Prince William	respect
In fact I am quite snappy and irritable, and I don't know if I'd like to make myself worse in that respect.	Nigella Lawson	respect
I do think that, at one time, being an actress was the equivalent almost of being a prostitute. It garnered roughly the same respect. That's changed a lot, thank goodness.	Michelle Pfeiffer	respect
I'm definitely bicoastal, but I have to say, it's easier to live in New York than in L.A. I feel like people respect other people's space a bit more here.	Mary-Kate Olsen	respect
I was always fascinated by engineering. Maybe it was an attempt maybe to get my father's respect or interest, or maybe it was just a genetic love of technology, but I was always trying to build things.	James Cameron	respect
Americans will respect your beliefs if you just keep them private.	Bill O'Reilly	respect
And they like being able to turn on the television day in and day out to see someone that they know and they feel comfortable with and trust hopefully and respect even.	Katie Couric	respect
A lot of the time, the way it's portrayed is that I only see women in a sexual way. But I grew up with just my mum and sister, so I respect women a lot.	Harry Styles	respect
I want to be remembered as somebody that tried to respect her integrity as an artist and as a person. And I don't want to be in any box. I don't want to be one thing.	Penelope Cruz	respect
You respect all of these people that you know in the business as actors. And they sort of turn around and say, we really like your work. It's a nice acknowledgment.	Lucy Liu	respect
We're in such a volatile climate right now politically. I think they didn't want Assassins to not succeed due to popular opinion and politics, versus on its own merits. I can respect that.	Neil Patrick Harris	respect
Deceiving others. That is what the world calls a romance.	Oscar Wilde	romantic
The word 'romance,' according to the dictionary, means excitement, adventure, and something extremely real. Romance should last a lifetime.	Billy Graham	romantic
The telephone, which interrupts the most serious conversations and cuts short the most weighty observations, has a romance of its own.	Virginia Woolf	romantic
I think romance is anything honest. As long as it's honest, it's so disarming.	Kristen Stewart	romantic
Remember, beneath every cynic there lies a romantic, and probably an injured one.	Glenn Beck	romantic

I believe that when you're in love you have to pour your heart and soul out to your partner... or why bother? So in that sense I'm an incurable romantic when it comes to men.	Cameron Diaz	romantic
There's something really great and romantic about being poor and sleeping on couches.	Ben Affleck	romantic

I think I'll always be a hopeless romantic.	Kim Kardashian	romantic
I love surprises - champagne and strawberries, all that pampering, romantic stuff. Guys ought to know how to pamper their women properly.	Danica McKellar	romantic
If a man lets all of my dogs sleep in the bed with us, then that is the most romantic thing. You must love my dogs in order to love me. A man who is nice to my animals and doesn't shoo them away - well, that's the height of romance.	Salma Hayek	romantic
I don't get off on romantic parts. But I often think if I had had my dental work done early on, well, maybe.	Morgan Freeman	romantic
I'm very romantic and of course I want to be in love.	Emma Watson	romantic

I have never acted he has never been cast in a romantic lead or has been cast opposite a female love interest in any movie he starred in.	Morgan Freeman	romantic
I want to do the romantic comedies. You know, the stuff that Meg Ryan and Julia Roberts or Reese Witherspoon would choose, of course.	Jessica Simpson	romantic
Usually comedy is only available to us ladies in the romantic comedy. That's why I hate romantic comedies.	Sandra Bullock	romantic
I think in general, romantic comedies tend to take one person's point of view, but every once in a while you get something that is balanced for two people.	Sandra Bullock	romantic
If I eat a huge meal and I can get the girl to rub my belly, I think that's about as romantic as I can think of.	Ryan Gosling	romantic
My new movie, Fools Rush In, is a romantic comedy and the girl I play in that is very warm, very sweet.	Salma Hayek	romantic
I will never say never, but I will say never to doing the more typical romantic comedies. You know, unless I'm getting audited and I'm on the street and I desperately need some dough and that's the only thing that I'm getting.	Christian Bale	romantic
The only thing I would unequivocally say is that I have never had any interest in romantic comedy I just couldn't do it. I think I'd be terrible.	Christian Bale	romantic
I am a hopeless romantic. And I won't stop till I get it right.	Halle Berry	romantic
Even actresses that you really admire, like Reese Witherspoon, you think, 'Another romantic comedy?' You see her in something like 'Walk the Line' and think, 'God, you're so great!' And then you think, 'Why is she doing these stupid romantic comedies?' But of course, it's for money and status.	Gwyneth Paltrow	romantic
I've always been attracted to romantic secondhand clothes. But my style developed as I started going to these strange raves where everybody had these very definitive costumes.	Florence Welch	romantic
I'm probably a bit romantic about it, but I think we humans miss having contact with fire. We need it.	Jamie Oliver	romantic
I'm a romantic.	Tom Cruise	romantic
If I were given a choice between two films and one was dark and explored depraved, troubled or sick aspects of our culture, I would always opt for that over the next romantic comedy.	David Schwimmer	romantic
I'm better with my hands, and I always loved the slightly romantic idea of starting with bits of wood and being able to create something to sit on, to eat from, to store your clothes in.	Jamie Oliver	romantic
My music is bejewelled, it's colourful, it's romantic, it shines.	Carly Rae Jepsen	romantic

I'd like to classify my life as a romantic comedy. Unfortunately I feel it's probably more like a TV reality show.	Uma Thurman	romantic
For a romantic comedy to be three hours long, that's longer than most marriages.	David Fincher	romantic
The reason I turn down 99% of a hundred, I mean a thousand, scripts is because romantic comedies are often very romantic but seldom very funny.	Hugh Grant	romantic
You won't find me in a romantic comedy. Those movies don't speak to me. People don't come to talk to me about those scripts, because they probably think I'm this dark, twisted, miserable person.	Naomi Watts	romantic

Can I see another's woe, and not be in sorrow too? Can I see another's grief, and not seek for kind relief?	William Blake	sad
I was raised in an atmosphere of 'everything's fine.' But as I got older, I was like, 'Well no, everything's not fine. There is stuff that's sad.' I am a really sensitive person. I think I am too sensitive sometimes.	Ellen DeGeneres	sad
When I seemed to be irritable or sad, my father would quote the learned Dr. Knight, and then say, 'Just go to sleep.' Like all smart aleck kids, I thought the advice was silly. But as I've grown older, I've realized just how smart Knight was.	Ben Stein	sad

Being on your own would be sad, sick and weird. I don't trust myself. I need that balance.	Daniel Craig	sad
The sad thing is that I feel so boring because 'Twilight' is literally how every conversation I have these days begins - whether it's someone I'm meeting for the first time or someone I just haven't seen in a while.

I've got to be high class... Which is sad, because I like bars.	Daniel Craig	sad

The hardest thing is at the end you have to say bye to all these people who you have worked with for so many months. It was really sad not to see them anymore. But you have the parties that you go to and you get to see them, like the premieres and the screenings.	Dakota Fanning	sad
No not really, it is just like real life. Not everyday you are happy and not everyday you are sad.	Dakota Fanning	sad
One of the sad things about contemporary journalism is that it actually matters very little. The world now is almost inured to the power of journalism. The best journalism would manage to outrage people. And people are less and less inclined to outrage.	David Simon	sad
Only two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity, and I'm not sure about the former.	Albert Einstein	science

We live in a society exquisitely dependent on science and technology, in which hardly anyone knows anything about science and technology.	Carl Sagan	science

If we long to believe that the stars rise and set for us, that we are the reason there is a Universe, does science do us a disservice in deflating our conceits?	Carl Sagan	science
When I die, I'm leaving my body to science fiction.	Steven Wright	science
Science is what you know, philosophy is what you don't know.	Bertrand Russell	science

Specialized meaninglessness has come to be regarded, in certain circles, as a kind of hallmark of true science.	Aldous Huxley	science
We've arranged a civilization in which most crucial elements profoundly depend on science and technology.	Carl Sagan	science

The product of mental labor - science - always stands far below its value, because the labor-time necessary to reproduce it has no relation at all to the labor-time required for its original production.	Karl Marx	science
Almost everything that distinguishes the modern world from earlier centuries is attributable to science, which achieved its most spectacular triumphs in the seventeenth century.	Bertrand Russell	science
Natural science will in time incorporate into itself the science of man, just as the science of man will incorporate into itself natural science: there will be one science.	Karl Marx	science

The enlightenment is under threat. So is reason. So is truth. So is science, especially in the schools of America.	Richard Dawkins	science
The usual approach of science of constructing a mathematical model cannot answer the questions of why there should be a universe for the model to describe. Why does the universe go to all the bother of existing?	Stephen Hawking	science
Science is not only a disciple of reason but, also, one of romance and passion.	Stephen Hawking	science

The violent reaction on the recent development of modern physics can only be understood when one realises that here the foundations of physics have started moving and that this motion has caused the feeling that the ground would be cut from science.	Werner Heisenberg	science
'Rocket Science' is really where I fell in love with filmmaking, I think 'Camp' was incredible, but it was so bizarre, and I was trying to find my footing in this world where you don't have an audience for immediate validation.	Anna Kendrick	science
Teachers started recognizing me and praising me for being smart in science and that made me want to be even smarter in science!	Steve Wozniak	science
I had read tons of science fiction. I was fascinated by other worlds, other environments. For me, it was fantasy, but it was not fantasy in the sense of pure escapism.	James Cameron	science

I don't mind a little Sturm und Drang. When I was doing 'Riding in Cars With Boys,' I wouldn't smile at anybody, because my character, Bev, was angry at the world. I'm the opposite. Inside my head I'd be like, God, I'll explain to you at the end of shooting that I'm not this person.	Drew Barrymore	smile
Later in my life, I'm going to look back and smile and be very fulfilled. I know that if I don't give it my all right now I'll regret it later. That's very important to me, because I've worked all my life to have this.	Shania Twain	smile
I was walking around legally blind. Now I have 20-20 vision. I can't believe I spent so many years blurry, but I think that coincides with how I was feeling. Now I notice if people are watching me, but I also smile right back if someone waves, which helps.	Nicole Kidman	smile

We have a system that increasingly taxes work and subsidizes nonwork.	Milton Friedman	society

Society has always seemed to demand a little more from human beings than it will get in practice.	George Orwell	society
We must reject the idea that every time a law's broken, society is guilty rather than the lawbreaker. It is time to restore the American precept that each individual is accountable for his actions.	Ronald Reagan	society
Our society is run by insane people for insane objectives. I think we're being run by maniacs for maniacal ends and I think I'm liable to be put away as insane for expressing that. That's what's insane about it.	John Lennon	society

I know of no safe depository of the ultimate powers of the society but the people themselves and if we think them not enlightened enough to exercise their control with a wholesome discretion, the remedy is not to take it from them but to inform their discretion.	Thomas Jefferson	society
Truth is certainly a branch of morality and a very important one to society.	Thomas Jefferson	society
I claim that human mind or human society is not divided into watertight compartments called social, political and religious. All act and react upon one another.	Mahatma Gandhi	society
If one could only teach the English how to talk, and the Irish how to listen, society here would be quite civilized.	Oscar Wilde	society
Society exists only as a mental concept in the real world there are only individuals.	Oscar Wilde	society
My role in society, or any artist's or poet's role, is to try and express what we all feel. Not to tell people how to feel. Not as a preacher, not as a leader, but as a reflection of us all.	John Lennon	society
To educate a man in mind and not in morals is to educate a menace to society.	Theodore Roosevelt	society
I suppose society is wonderfully delightful. To be in it is merely a bore. But to be out of it is simply a tragedy.	Oscar Wilde	society
The basic thing nobody asks is why do people take drugs of any sort? Why do we have these accessories to normal living to live? I mean, is there something wrong with society that's making us so pressurized, that we cannot live without guarding ourselves against it?	John Lennon	society
There can be no keener revelation of a society's soul than the way in which it treats its children.	Nelson Mandela	society
The society based on production is only productive, not creative.	Albert Camus	society
I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities.	Nelson Mandela	society
I should tie myself to no particular system of society other than of socialism.	Nelson Mandela	society
Crimes against children are the most heinous crime. That, for me, would be a reason for capital punishment because children are innocent and need the guidance of an adult society.	Clint Eastwood	society
The smarter the journalists are, the better off society is. For to a degree, people read the press to inform themselves - and the better the teacher, the better the student body.	Warren Buffett	society
In December, I agreed to extend the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans because it was the only way I could prevent a tax hike on middle-class Americans.

I've always wanted to own and control the primary technology in everything we do.	Steve Jobs	technology

War is mainly a catalogue of blunders.	Winston Churchill	war

Four years ago, I promised to end the war in Iraq. We did. I promised to refocus on the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11. We have.

A new tower rises above the New York skyline, al Qaeda is on the path to defeat, and Osama bin Laden is dead.	Barack Obama	war

The United States is not, and never will be, at war with Islam.	Barack Obama	war
Americans play to win at all times. I wouldn't give a hoot and hell for a man who lost and laughed. That's why Americans have never lost nor ever lose a war.	George S. Patton	war
Sometimes by losing a battle you find a new way to win the war.	Donald Trump	war

Every war when it comes, or before it comes, is represented not as a war but as an act of self-defense against a homicidal maniac.	George Orwell	war
I don't oppose all wars. What I am opposed to is a dumb war. What I am opposed to is a rash war.	Barack Obama	war
Another term for preventive war is aggressive war - starting wars because someday somebody might do something to us. That is not part of the American tradition.	Ron Paul	war

Operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and the war on terrorism have reduced the pace of military transformation and have revealed our lack of preparation for defensive and stability operations. This Administration has overextended our military.	Barack Obama	war

We're not going to baby sit a civil war.	Barack Obama	war

War is a contagion.	Franklin D. Roosevelt	war
Throughout the 20th century, the Republican Party benefited from a non-interventionist foreign policy. Think of how Eisenhower came in to stop the Korean War. Think of how Nixon was elected to stop the mess in Vietnam.	Ron Paul	war

It is not only the living who are killed in war.	Isaac Asimov	war
Of all the enemies of public liberty, war is perhaps the most to be dreaded, because it comprises and develops the germ of every other.	James Madison	war
Even philosophers will praise war as ennobling mankind, forgetting the Greek who said: 'War is bad in that it begets more evil than it kills.'	Immanuel Kant	war
It is good that war is so horrible, or we might grow to like it.	Robert E. Lee	war
The war... was an unnecessary condition of affairs, and might have been avoided if forebearance and wisdom had been practiced on both sides.	Robert E. Lee	war
Total war is no longer war waged by all members of one national community against all those of another. It is total... because it may well involve the whole world.	Jean-Paul Sartre	war

In war, events of importance are the result of trivial causes.	Julius Caesar	war

This administration here and now declares unconditional war on poverty.	Lyndon B. Johnson	war
I'm tired. I'm tired of feeling rejected by the American people. I'm tired of waking up in the middle of the night worrying about the war.	Lyndon B. Johnson	war
War contains so much folly, as well as wickedness, that much is to be hoped from the progress of reason.	James Madison	war
This is an important book, the critic assumes, because it deals with war. This is an insignificant book because it deals with the feelings of women in a drawing-room.	Virginia Woolf	war
I love it when Muslims go to war with each other, as I do when the Christians do, because it shows there's no such thing as the Christian world and the Islamic world. That's all crap.	Christopher Hitchens	war
It is Barack Obama who is at war with this country. Recent events prove it. This is not a cliche. It's not a figure of speech. Obama is at war with the U.S. economy.	Rush Limbaugh	war
All this happened, more or less. The war parts, anyway, are pretty much true.	Kurt Vonnegut	war
The condition of man... is a condition of war of everyone against everyone.	Thomas Hobbes	war

Virtue is a state of war, and to live in it we have always to combat with ourselves.	Jean-Jacques Rousseau	war
Some have argued that confronting the threat from Iraq could detract from the war against terror. To the contrary, confronting the threat posed by Iraq is crucial to winning the war on terror.	George W. Bush	war
This was not an act of terrorism, but it was an act of war.	George W. Bush	war
With those attacks, the terrorists and their supporters declared war on the United States. And war is what they got.	George W. Bush	war
For one thing, I don't think that anybody in any war thinks of themselves as a hero.	Steven Spielberg	war

War is a blessing compared with national degradation.	Andrew Jackson	war
What is more immoral than war?	Marquis de Sade	war

When war comes, two things happen - profits go way, way up and all perishables go way, way down. There becomes a market for them.	Steven Spielberg	war
In the re-creation of combat situations, and this is coming from a director who's never been in one, being mindful of what these veterans have actually gone through, you find that the biggest concern is that you don't look at war as a geopolitical endeavor.	Steven Spielberg	war
As for charity, it is a matter in which the immediate effect on the persons directly concerned, and the ultimate consequence to the general good, are apt to be at complete war with one another.	John Stuart Mill	war
Australians are coffee snobs. An influx of Italian immigrants after World War II ensured that - we probably had the word 'cappuccino' about 20 years before America. Cafe culture is really big for Aussies. We like to work hard, but we take our leisure time seriously.	Hugh Jackman	war
This is not Johnson's war. This is America's war. If I drop dead tomorrow, this war will still be with you.	Lyndon B. Johnson	war
I don't think the war in Afghanistan was ruthlessly enough waged.	Christopher Hitchens	war
A faction willing to take the risks of making war on the ossified status quo in the Middle East can be described as many things, but not as conservative.	Christopher Hitchens	war

Nullification means insurrection and war and the other states have a right to put it down.	Andrew Jackson	war
I want a world without war, a world without insanity. I want to see people do well. I don't even think it's as much as what I want for myself. It's more what I want for the people around me. That's what I want.	Tom Cruise	war
There's no doubt that usually a president's public image is enhanced by going to war. That never did appeal to me.	Jimmy Carter	war
I had very good support from Democrats and Republicans all throughout my administration. I had a very high batting average. We added more jobs per year in my four years than any other president since the Second World War.	Jimmy Carter	war
If men make war in slavish obedience to rules, they will fail.	Ulysses S. Grant	war
War is organized murder and torture against our brothers.	Alfred Adler	war
I was a little girl in World War II and I'm used to being freed by Americans.	Madeleine Albright	war
The U.N. bureaucracy has grown to elephantine proportions. Now that the Cold War is over, we are asking that elephant to do gymnastics.	Madeleine Albright	war
I saw what happened when a dictator was allowed to take over a piece of a country and the country went down the tubes. And I saw the opposite during the war when America joined the fight.	Madeleine Albright	war
I had nearly finished school because I was making effort not that bad on that. But there was a law in Germany after the war. You could not make your final examination before 18, so lots of people who were late because of the way had to do it first.	Karl Lagerfeld	war
Mine is the first generation able to contemplate the possibility that we may live our entire lives without going to war or sending our children to war.	Tony Blair	war
To all those who walk the path of human cooperation war must appear loathsome and inhuman.	Alfred Adler	war
For what can war, but endless war, still breed?	John Milton	war
War has become a luxury that only small nations can afford.	Hannah Arendt	war

Force and fraud are in war the two cardinal virtues.	Thomas Hobbes	war
I'm a lad of the '60s. I started a magazine to try and end the Vietnam war, but it was a number of years before I had the profile, the financial resources and the time to do more.	Richard Branson	war
In April 1991, after the Gulf war, Iraq was given 15 days to provide a full and final declaration of all its WMD.	Tony Blair	war
I can't go to war with paparazzi.	Daniel Craig	war
Everybody has a job to do. There are people in Iraq on both sides of this war who do what they do for religious reasons, and they feel with God on their side. Some people are good at annihilating people. Maybe that's their gift.	Denzel Washington	war
New terms used like, 'overseas contingency operation' instead of the word 'war' - that reflects a worldview that is out of touch with the enemy that we face. We can't spin our way out of this threat.	Sarah Palin	war
Despite what the pundits want us to think, contested primaries aren't civil war, they are democracy at work, and that's beautiful.	Sarah Palin	war
We are at war, and our security as a nation depends on winning that war.	Condoleezza Rice	war
I have a friend that is a WWII buff, and we sat and talked a lot about stuff like the war and the reasons behind it, and you now it's all in the uniform. Once you're in it, it usually does all the work for you.	Ryan Gosling	war
War consisteth not in battle only, or the act of fighting but in a tract of time, wherein the will to contend by battle is sufficiently known.	Thomas Hobbes	war
Conservatives saw the savagery of 9/11 in the attacks and prepared for war liberals saw the savagery of the 9/11 attacks and wanted to prepare indictments and offer therapy and understanding for our attackers.	Karl Rove	war
Winston Churchill aroused this nation in heroic fashion to save civilisation in World War Two. We have everything we need except political will, but political will is a renewable resource.	Al Gore	war
A majority of this country opposes this war, a majority of this country never voted for this administration.	Michael Moore	war
I have absolutely no regret about my vote against this war. The same questions remain. The cost in human lives, the cost to our budget, probably 100 billion. We could have probably brought down that statue for a lot less.	Nancy Pelosi	war
People like to make fun of the fans who camp out but people have renaissance fairs people do Civil War re-enactments people do what they like. I'm tired of hearing people rage on the fans. If you don't like 'Twilight,' don't buy a ticket.	Anna Kendrick	war
The Cold War was over long before it was officially declared dead.	John le Carre	war
During the Cold War, we lived in coded times when it wasn't easy and there were shades of grey and ambiguity.	John le Carre	war
In every war zone that I've been in, there has been a reality and then there has been the public perception of why the war was being fought. In every crisis, the issues have been far more complex than the public has been allowed to know.	John le Carre	war
I worked for MI6 in the Sixties, during the great witch-hunts, when the shared paranoia of the Cold War gripped the services.	John le Carre	war
I think the record speaks for itself. These are two individuals who have been for the war when the headlines were good and against it when their poll ratings were bad.	Dick Cheney	war
It's very important to go back and keep in mind the distinction between handling these events as criminal acts, which was the way we did before 9/11, and then looking at 9/11 and saying, 'This is not a criminal act,' not when you destroy 16 acres of Manhattan, kill 3,000 Americans, blow a big hole in the Pentagon. That's an act of war.	Dick Cheney	war
From our perspective, trying to deal with this continuing campaign of terror, if you will, the war on terror that we're engaged in, this is a continuing enterprise. The people that were involved in some of those activities before 9/11 are still out there.	Dick Cheney	war
It's never acceptable to target civilians. It violates the Geneva Accords, it violates the international law of war and it violates all principles of morality.	Alan Dershowitz	war
I mean, I was born the day war broke out, but I don't remember all the bombs though they did actually break up Liverpool, you know. I remember when I was a little older, there was big gaps in all the streets where houses used to be. We used to play over them.	Ringo Starr	war
I've always been at war with myself, for right or wrong.	Brad Pitt	war
The fact is, Bush's war policy has failed. It's failed! Who better to say so than Jack Murtha?	Rahm Emanuel	war
When I was in Pulp, I actively did more TV stuff because that was during the Great Britpop Wars, and it seemed important to prove that indie people could speak. That war doesn't exist anymore.	Jarvis Cocker	war
We live in the time where we have fictitious election results that elects a fictitious president. We live in a time where we have a man sending us to war for fictitious reasons.	Michael Moore	war
I feel like war should occur only for the most vital and necessary reasons, and only then.	Sharon Stone	war
The chain of wedlock is so heavy that it takes two to carry it - and sometimes three.	Heraclitus	wedding
I'd imagine my wedding as a fairy tale... huge, beautiful and white.	Paris Hilton	wedding
I remember when I was in school, they would ask, 'What are you going to be when you grow up?' and then you'd have to draw a picture of it. I drew a picture of myself as a bride.	Gwen Stefani	wedding
I think that weddings have probably been crashed since the beginning of time. Cavemen crashed them. You go to meet girls. It makes sense.	Christopher Walken	wedding
The Wedding March has a bit of a death march in it.	Brian May	wedding
I've always been the type to fall in love fast and, with every boyfriend, I plan out my wedding in my head.	Kim Kardashian	wedding
We were pretty good mates until the Beatles started to split up and Yoko came into it. It was more like old army buddies splitting up on account of wedding bells.	Paul McCartney	wedding
One tradition I have with my friends is that when one of us gets married, we have a ton of fragrance oils and pretty bottles at the bachelorette party. Everyone puts a drop or two in a bottle for the bride and makes a wish, and the bride wears our creation on her wedding day.	Jennifer Aniston	wedding
A man's got two shots for jewelry: a wedding ring and a watch. The watch is a lot easier to get on and off than a wedding ring.	John Mayer	wedding
I don't ever really feel that wearing my wedding ring is what determines me being married or not.	Jessica Simpson	wedding
I've never crashed a wedding. When I was a kid I, of course, used to crash parties. Crashing a wedding is difficult though because you have to have the suit, and you have to have information in case someone catches you. You have to know at least some names and something.	Christopher Walken	wedding
I try to remember, as I hear about friends getting engaged, that it's not about the ring and it's not about the wedding. It's a grave thing, getting married. And it's easy to get swept up in the wrong things.	Gwyneth Paltrow	wedding
I am usually part of any disaster at a wedding if I'm a bridesmaid, which I've been lucky enough to be several times.	Jennifer Garner	wedding
We all went to Kelsey's wedding, and yeah, we go to parties. We also go to each other's house. A group of us got together over at Kelsey's and just read through some plays just for the fun of it. That may not be everyone's idea of a good time, but we had a good time.	David Hyde Pierce	wedding
I always envisioned myself having a traditional and elegant wedding.	Ivanka Trump	wedding

There is more wisdom in your body than in your deepest philosophy.	Friedrich Nietzsche	wisdom
Follow your instincts. That's where true wisdom manifests itself.	Oprah Winfrey	wisdom
No party has a monopoly on wisdom. No democracy works without compromise. But when Governor Romney and his allies in Congress tell us we can somehow lower our deficit by spending trillions more on new tax breaks for the wealthy - well, you do the math. I refuse to go along with that. And as long as I'm President, I never will.	Barack Obama	wisdom
But what is liberty without wisdom, and without virtue? It is the greatest of all possible evils for it is folly, vice, and madness, without tuition or restraint.	Edmund Burke	wisdom

I learned some valuable lessons about the legislative process, the importance of bipartisan cooperation and the wisdom of taking small steps to get a big job done.	Hillary Clinton	wisdom

The hours of folly are measured by the clock but of wisdom, no clock can measure.	William Blake	wisdom
Enraging liberals is simply one of the more enjoyable side effects of my wisdom.	Rush Limbaugh	wisdom
What wisdom can you find that is greater than kindness?	Jean-Jacques Rousseau	wisdom
Every nation whose affairs betray a want of wisdom and stability may calculate on every loss which can be sustained from the more systematic policy of its wiser neighbors.	James Madison	wisdom
In my definition of consciousness, consciousness is the same thing as life. What wisdom traditions also call spirit.	Deepak Chopra	wisdom
It is not wisdom but Authority that makes a law.	Thomas Hobbes	wisdom
The word philosophy sounds high-minded, but it simply means the love of wisdom. If you love something, you don't just read about it you hug it, you mess with it, you play with it, you argue with it.	Hugh Jackman	wisdom
It seems to me that, in every culture, I come across a chapter headed 'Wisdom.' And then I know exactly what is going to follow: 'Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.'	Ludwig Wittgenstein	wisdom

If women ran the world we wouldn't have wars, just intense negotiations every 28 days.	Robin Williams	women
I seem to be getting a lot of things pushed my way that are strong women. It's like people see Hackers and they send me offers to play tough women with guns, the kind who wear no bra and a little tank top. I'd like to play strong women who are also very feminine.	Angelina Jolie	women

I've been trying to find women writers for my staff for a while now and I have three women on my staff and three guys so it's pretty equal. I don't know why that is. It's been the same thing for a while. It's hard for female comedians to stand out. That's weird. That's a shame.	Ellen DeGeneres	women
Comedy can be, especially in a writer's room, really aggressive, kind of a very male-dominated room, and it would be hard for women. It's not a nurturing place.

I remember when the wave of Jennifer Lopez, Salma Hayek and these beautiful Hispanic women came into light, and I looked up to them and I loved them, but I was like, 'Where are Middle Eastern women?'	Kim Kardashian	women

There's very little advice in men's magazines, because men don't think there's a lot they don't know. Women do. Women want to learn. Men think, 'I know what I'm doing, just show me somebody naked.'	Jerry Seinfeld	women
Women priests. Great, great. Now there's priests of both sexes I don't listen to.	Bill Hicks	women
When I get up and work out, I'm working out just as much for my girls as I am for me, because I want them to see a mother who loves them dearly, who invests in them, but who also invests in herself. It's just as much about letting them know as young women that it is okay to put yourself a little higher on your priority list.	Michelle Obama	women

Growing up with the childhood that I had, I learned to never let a man make me feel helpless, and it also embedded a deep need in me to always stick up for women.	Christina Aguilera	women
I think women are really good at making friends and not good at networking. Men are good at networking and not necessarily making friends. That's a gross generalization, but I think it holds in many ways.	Madeleine Albright	women
I have said this many times, that there seems to be enough room in the world for mediocre men, but not for mediocre women, and we really have to work very, very hard.	Madeleine Albright	women
To be outspoken, or different at all, is a problem for women.	Megan Fox	women

My decision to register women confirms what is already obvious throughout our society-that women are now providing all types of skills in every profession. The military should be no exception.	Jimmy Carter	women
If we took away women's right to vote, we'd never have to worry about another Democrat president.	Ann Coulter	women
I noticed in the past, a lot of guys who like strong women, they really freak out if you're not strong 24/7. Or they complain about you being strong, then the moment you're not strong, they're like, 'Oh, no, no, no.'	Salma Hayek	women
I think all of us as women have this super-human quality. We create life, we give life, we are the sources of life for our children - we're all pretty bionic.	Christina Aguilera	women
I definitely love women. They are more attractive to the naked eye.	Christina Aguilera	women
My favorite play in drama school was 'The Bacchae.' It's about a king who literally gets eaten alive by all the women in the play in a kind of orgy - it's related to the word 'bacchanal' - and I loved that idea of animalistic chaos and following our own desires.	Hugh Jackman	women
The violence betwen women is unbelievable. Women try to make each other crawl so that their knees are bleeding.	Tori Amos	women
My father has a pragmatic mind. He marched with Dr. King in the '60s, and he's very much for women's rights.	Tori Amos	women
There is a phenomenal amount of pressure on women in this industry: they are considered vintage by the time they hit their mid-30s.	Tori Amos	women
There are older men with younger women but you don't see a lot of older women with younger men. There are some women who have been able to do it but not often.	Tori Amos	women

Women can't do everything at the same time, we need to understand milestones in our lives comes in segments.	Madeleine Albright	women
The fact that the church is convinced of not having the right to confer priestly ordination on women is now considered by some as irreconcilable with the European Constitution.	Joseph Ratzinger	women

I like women. I don't understand them, but I like them.	Sean Connery	women
Some men have a silly theory about beautiful women - that somewhere along the line they'll turn into a monster. That movie gave them a chance to watch it happen.	Salma Hayek	women
I did go to Wellesley, a women's college. And I am of a kind of strange generation which is transitional in terms of women who wanted to go out and get jobs.	Madeleine Albright	women
I didn't want to set up a women's studies program. I thought women should learn to operate in a coeducational atmosphere, because, especially in national security and international affairs, it's male-dominated.	Madeleine Albright	women
I think the personal relationships I established mattered in terms of what I was able to get done. And I did bring women's issues to the center of our foreign policy.	Madeleine Albright	women

All women in Hollywood are known as sex symbols.	Megan Fox	women
And what I saw happening is that women don't make one decision to leave the workforce. They makes lots of little decisions really far in advance that kind of inevitably lead them there.	Sheryl Sandberg	women
Women are not making it to the top. A hundred and ninety heads of state nine are women. Of all the people in parliament in the world, thirteen per cent are women. In the corporate sector, women at the top - C-level jobs, board seats - tops out at fifteen, sixteen per cent.	Sheryl Sandberg	women
There are women who take it to the wire. That's what they are looking for, the ultimate confrontation. They want a smack.	Sean Connery	women
When I am cast in a movie where I feel that the woman's part is more interesting, I usually start thinking about Spencer Tracy and Fred Astaire. They seem to be the most clear actors when working with women.	Jack Nicholson	women
If you ask men why they did a good job, they'll say, 'I'm awesome. Obviously. Why are you even asking?' If you ask women why they did a good job, what they'll say is someone helped them, they got lucky, they worked really hard.	Sheryl Sandberg	women

We need to steer clear of this poverty of ambition, where people want to drive fancy cars and wear nice clothes and live in nice apartments but don't want to work hard to accomplish these things. Everyone should try to realize their full potential.	Barack Obama	work
The miracle is not that we do this work, but that we are happy to do it.	Mother Teresa	work

Work as if you were to live a hundred years. Pray as if you were to die tomorrow.	Benjamin Franklin	work

Our fatigue is often caused not by work, but by worry, frustration and resentment.	Dale Carnegie	work
When Thomas Edison worked late into the night on the electric light, he had to do it by gas lamp or candle. I'm sure it made the work seem that much more urgent.	George Carlin	work

It behooves every man to remember that the work of the critic is of altogether secondary importance, and that, in the end, progress is accomplished by the man who does things.	Theodore Roosevelt	work

The people who are doing the work are the moving force behind the Macintosh. My job is to create a space for them, to clear out the rest of the organization and keep it at bay.	Steve Jobs	work

People from both political parties have long recognized that welfare without work creates negative incentives that lead to permanent poverty. It robs people of self-esteem.	Mitt Romney	work

If you start by promising what you don't even have yet, you'll lose your desire to work towards getting it.	Paulo Coelho	work
The flowery style is not unsuitable to public speeches or addresses, which amount only to compliment. The lighter beauties are in their place when there is nothing more solid to say but the flowery style ought to be banished from a pleading, a sermon, or a didactic work.	Voltaire	work
Work is of two kinds: first, altering the position of matter at or near the earth's surface relative to other matter second, telling other people to do so.	Bertrand Russell	work
My mind rebels at stagnation. Give me problems, give me work, give me the most abstruse cryptogram, or the most intricate analysis, and I am in my own proper atmosphere. But I abhor the dull routine of existence. I crave for mental exaltation.	Arthur Conan Doyle	work
People intoxicate themselves with work so they won't see how they really are.	Aldous Huxley	work

I never expect to see a perfect work from an imperfect man.	Alexander Hamilton	work
It's hard to do it because you gotta look people in the eye and tell 'em they're irresponsible and lazy. And who's gonna wanna do that? Because that's what poverty is, ladies and gentlemen. In this country, you can succeed if you get educated and work hard. Period. Period.	Bill O'Reilly	work

The first lesson I've learned is that no matter what you do in your life, you have to figure out your own internal rhythms - I mean, what works for you doesn't necessarily work for your friend.	Hillary Clinton	work
I'm one of these very focused people when it comes to day-to-day work, and I'm trying not to think about what comes next so that I can stay very focused on what I'm doing now.	Hillary Clinton	work

I suppose I have a really loose interpretation of 'work,' because I think that just being alive is so much work at something you don't always want to do. The machinery is always going. Even when you sleep.	Andy Warhol	work
Never despair, but if you do, work on in despair.	Edmund Burke	work
The United States strongly condemns the illegal disclosure of classified information. It puts people's lives in danger, threatens our national security, and undermines our efforts to work with other countries to solve shared problems.	Hillary Clinton	work
Work gives you meaning and purpose and life is empty without it.	Stephen Hawking	work
I think I should be active politically. Because I look upon myself as a politician. That's not a dirty work you know. Some people think that there are something wrong with politicians. Of course, something wrong with some politicians.	Aung San Suu Kyi	work
Look I eat really well and I work out, but I also indulge when I want to. I don't starve myself in an extremist way. You're not taking away my coffee or my dairy or my glass of wine because I'd be devastated.	Jennifer Aniston	work
People don't understand that when I grew up, I was never the most talented. I was never the biggest. I was never the fastest. I certainly was never the strongest. The only thing I had was my work ethic, and that's been what has gotten me this far.	Tiger Woods	work

I don't work at being ordinary.	Paul McCartney	work
I approach love differently now that I know it's hard for it to work out.	Taylor Swift	work
The productivity now at universities is terrible. Tenure is a terrible idea. It keeps them around forever and they don't have to work hard.	Jack Welch	work
The average person puts only 25% of his energy and ability into his work. The world takes off its hat to those who put in more than 50% of their capacity, and stands on its head for those few and far between souls who devote 100%.	Andrew Carnegie	work
At 35, I'm definitely starting to feel more like a grown-up than I ever have. There's nothing in my life that is childish or whimsical. Having fun is fantastic and I never want to lose a sense of that - and also, I think, you have to have that to put into your work or else it's going to feel stiff.	Drew Barrymore	work
We learned about dignity and decency - that how hard you work matters more than how much you make... that helping others means more than just getting ahead yourself.	Michelle Obama	work
A serious and good philosophical work could be written consisting entirely of jokes.	Ludwig Wittgenstein	work

I'm far from being god, but I work god damn hard.	Jay-Z	work
All I do, really, is go to work and try to be professional, be on time and be prepared.	Ben Affleck	work
I've always wanted to work with Warren Beatty.	Quentin Tarantino	work
When you're around me and really see that all I do is live and breathe for my work, it's not strange, it's just Gaga.	Lady Gaga	work
I work very hard, but when God opens that door for you - when life opens that door for you, I should say - I think it's important to be giving, to return the love back.	Lady Gaga	work
It sometimes makes people feel better about themselves, you know, to put other people down, or make fun of them, or maybe make mockery of their work and that doesn't make me feel good at all.	Lady Gaga	work
I'm just an individual who doesn't feel that I need to have somebody qualify my work in any particular way. I'm working for me.	David Bowie	work
I like to talk about my obsession with french fries because I don't want people to think that 'Let's Move' is about complete, utter deprivation. It's about moderation and real-life changes and ideas that really work for families.	Michelle Obama	work
Integrate what you believe in every single area of your life. Take your heart to work and ask the most and best of everybody else, too.	Meryl Streep	work
My ideal relaxation is working on upholstry. I spend hours in junk shops buying furniture. I do all the upholstery work myself, and it's like therapy.	Pamela Anderson	work
Actresses can get outrageously precious about the way they look. That's not what life's about. If you starve yourself to the point where your brain cells shrivel, you will never do good work. And if you're overly conscious of your arms flapping in the wind, how can you look the other actor in the eye to respond to them?	Cate Blanchett	work
It will work. I am a marketing genius.	Paris Hilton	work
